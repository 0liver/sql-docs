# Automatic tuning
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ssvNxt-asdb-xxxx-xxx](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssvnxt-xxxx-xxxx-xxx.md)]  

  Automatic tuning is a database feature that provides insight into potential query performance problems, recommend solutions, and automatically fix identified problems.

Automatic tuning in [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14-md](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)], notifies you whenever a potential performance issue is detected, and lets you apply corrective actions,
or lets the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] automatically fix performance problems.
Automatic tuning in [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14-md](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] enables you to identify and fix performance issues caused by **SQL plan choice regressions**.

## What is plan choice regression?

[!INCLUDE[ssdenoversion_md](../../includes/ssdenoversion_md.md)] may use different SQL plans to execute the [!INCLUDE[tsql_md](../../includes/tsql_md.md)] queries. Query plans
depend on the statistics, indexes, and other factors. The optimal plan that should be used to execute some [!INCLUDE[tsql_md](../../includes/tsql_md.md)] query might be changed
over time. In some cases, the new plan might not be better than the previous one, and the new plan might cause a performance regression.

 ![SQL plan choice regression](media/plan-choice-regression.png "SQL plan choice regression") 

In order to prevent unexpected performance issues, users must periodically monitor system and look for the queries that regressed. If any plan regressed, user should find some
previous good plan and force it instead of the current one using `sp_query_store_force_plan` procedure. The best practice would be to force last known good plan because older plans might be invalid due to statistic or index changes.
The user who forces the last known good plan should monitor performance of the query that is executed using the forced plan and verify that forced plan works as expected. Depending on
the results of monitoring and analysis, plan should be forced or user should find some other way to optimize the query.
Manually forced plans should not be forced forever, because the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] should be able to apply optimal plans. The user or DBA should eventually
unforce the plan using `sp_query_store_unforce_plan` procedure, and let the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] find the optimal plan.

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides all necessary views and procedures required to monitor performance and fix problems in Query Store. However, continuous
monitoring and fixing performance issues might be a tedious process.

[!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14-md](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] provides information about regressed plans and recommended corrective actions.
Additionally, [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] enables you to fully automate this process and let [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] fix any problem found related 
to the plan changes.

## How to detect plan choice regression?

In [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14-md](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] detects and shows potential plan choice regressions and the recommended
actions that should be applied in the [sys.dm_db_tuning_recommendations &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-tuning-recommendations-transact-sql.md)
view. The view shows information about the problem, the importance of the issue, and details such as the
identified query, the id of the regressed plan, the id of the plan that was used as baseline for comparison, and the [!INCLUDE[tsql_md](../../includes/tsql_md.md)] statement that can
be executed to fix the problem.

| type | description | datetime | score | details | â€¦ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN` | CPU time changed from 4 ms to 14 ms | 3/17/2017 | 83 | `queryId` `recommendedPlanId` `regressedPlanId` `T-SQL` |   |
| `FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN` | CPU time changed from 37 ms to 84 ms | 3/16/2017 | 26 | `queryId` `recommendedPlanId` `regressedPlanId` `T-SQL` |   |

Some columns from this view are described in the following list:
 - Type of the recommended action - `FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN`.
 - Description that contains information why [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] thinks that this plan change is a potential performance regression.
 - Datetime when the potential regression is detected.
 - Score of this recommendation. 
 - Details about the issues such as id of the detected plan, id of the regressed plan, id of the plan that should be forced to fix the issue, [!INCLUDE[tsql_md](../../includes/tsql_md.md)]
 script that might be applied to fix the issue, etc. Details are stored in [JSON format](../../relational-databases/json/index.md).

Use the following query to obtain a script that fixes the issue and additional information about the estimated gain:

```   
SELECT reason, score,
      script = JSON_VALUE(details, '$.implementationDetails.script'),
      planForceDetails.*,
      estimated_gain = (regressedPlanExecutionCount+recommendedPlanExecutionCount)
                  *(regressedPlanCpuTimeAverage-recommendedPlanCpuTimeAverage)/1000000,
      error_prone = IIF(regressedPlanErrorCount>recommendedPlanErrorCount, 'YES','NO')
FROM sys.dm_db_tuning_recommendations
  CROSS APPLY OPENJSON (Details, '$.planForceDetails')
    WITH (  [query_id] int '$.queryId',
            [current plan_id] int '$.regressedPlanId',
            [recommended plan_id] int '$.recommendedPlanId',

            regressedPlanErrorCount int,
            recommendedPlanErrorCount int,

            regressedPlanExecutionCount int,
            regressedPlanCpuTimeAverage float,
            recommendedPlanExecutionCount int,
            recommendedPlanCpuTimeAverage float

          ) as planForceDetails;
```

[!INCLUDE[ssresult-md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]     

| reason | score | script | query\_id | current plan\_id | recommended plan\_id | estimated\_gain | error\_prone
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CPU time changed from 3 ms to 46 ms | 36 | EXEC sp\_query\_store\_force\_plan 12, 17; | 12 | 28 | 17 | 11.59 | 0

`estimated\_gain` represents the estimated number of seconds that would be saved if the recommended plan would be executed instead of the current plan. The recommended plan should be forced instead of the current plan if the gain is greater than 10 seconds. If there are more errors (for example, time-outs or aborted executions) in the current plan than in the recommended plan, the column `error\_prone` would be set to the value `YES`. Error prone plan is another reason why the recommended plan should be forced instead of the current one.

## Automatic plan choice correction

In addition to detection, the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] can automatically switch to the last known good plan whenever the regression is detected.

![SQL plan choice correction](media/force-last-good-plan.png "SQL plan choice correction") 

When the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] applies a recommendation, it automatically monitors the performance of the forced plan. The forced plan will be retained until
a recompile (for example, on next statistics or schema change) if it is better than the regressed plan. If the forced plan is not better than the regressed plan, the new plan will be unforced
and the [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] will compile a new plan.

The user can enable automatic tuning per database and specify that last good plan should be forced whenever some plan change regression is detected. Automatic tuning is enabled using
the following command:

```   
ALTER DATABASE current
SET AUTOMATIC_TUNING ( FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN = ON ); 
```
Once you turn-on this option, [!INCLUDE[ssde_md](../../includes/ssde_md.md)] will automatically force any recommendation where the gain is higher than 10 seconds, or the number of errors in the new plan is higher than the number of errors in the recommended plan, and verify that the forced plan is better than the current one.

The status of the automatic tuning option is shown in the following view:

```    
SELECT name, desired_state_desc, actual_state_desc, reason_desc
FROM sys.database_automatic_tuning_options;
```
[!INCLUDE[ssresult-md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]     

| name | desired\_state\_desc | actual\_state\_desc | reason\_desc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FORCE\_LAST\_GOOD\_PLAN | ON | OFF | QUERY_STORE_OFF |

`FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN` option might be in `OFF` state even if the user specified `ON`. The option might be disabled if Query Store is disabled or in read-only mode. Column `actual_state_desc`
gives information about the current state of automatic tuning option, and column `reason_desc` gives information why is actual state different that desired state.
Values in `reason_desc` column are shown in the following table:

| reason | reason\_desc | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | `DISABLED` | Option is disabled by system. |
| 11 | `QUERY_STORE_OFF` | Query Store is turned off. |
| 12 | `QUERY_STORE_READ_ONLY` | Query Store is in read-only mode. |
| 13 | `NOT_SUPPORTED` | Available only in Enterprise Edition of SQL Server. |
