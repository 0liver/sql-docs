# Tutorial: Getting started with Always Encrypted with secure enclaves in Azure SQL Database

[!INCLUDE [asdb](../../includes/applies-to-version/asdb.md)]

This tutorial teaches you how to get started with [Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves.md) in [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)]. It will show you:

- How to create a basic environment for testing and evaluating Always Encrypted with secure enclaves.
- How to encrypt data in-place and issue rich confidential queries against encrypted columns using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## Prerequisites

This tutorial requires Azure PowerShell and SQL Server Management Management Studio.

### PowerShell Requirements

See [Overview of Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure) for information on how to install and run Azure PowerShell. 

Minimum version of Az modules required to support attestation operations:

- Az 4.5.0
- Az.Accounts 1.9.2
- Az.Attestation 0.1.8

Run the below command to verify the installed version of all Az modules:

```powershell
Get-InstalledModule
```

If the versions are not matching with the minimum requirement, run Update-Module commands.

Please note that, the PowerShell Gallery has deprecated Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 and 1.1. TLS 1.2 or a later version is recommended. Hence you may receive the following errors:

- WARNING: Unable to resolve package source 'https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2'
- PackageManagement\Install-Package: No match was found for the specified search criteria and module name.

To continue to interact with the PowerShell Gallery, run the following command before the Install-Module commands

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```

### SSMS Requirements

See [Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md) for information on how to download SSMS.

The required minimum version of SSMS is 18.7.2.


## Step 1: Create a server and a DC-series database

 In this step, you will create a new Azure SQL Database server and a new database using the DC-series hardware configuration. Always Encrypted with secure enclaves in [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)] uses Intel SGX enclaves, which are supported in the DC-series hardware configuration. for more information, see [DC-series](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/service-tiers-vcore?tabs=azure-portal#dc-series).

1. Open a PowerShell console and s Sign in to Azure. If needed, switch to the subscription, you are using for this tutorial.

  ```PowerShell
  Connect-AzAccount
  $subscriptionId = '...'
  Set-AzContext -Subscription $serverSubscriptionId
  ```

2. Create a resource group to contain your database server. 

  ```powershell
  $serverResourceGroupName = "<server resource group name>"
  $serverLocation = "<Azure region that supports DC-series in SQL DB>"
  New-AzResourceGroup -Name $serverResourceGroupName -Location $serverLocation 
  ```

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > You need to create your resource group in a region that supports the DC-series hardware configuration. For the list of currently supported regions, see [DC-series](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/service-tiers-vcore?tabs=azure-portal#dc-series).

3. Create a database server. When prompted, enter the server administrator name and a password.

  ```powershell
  $serverName = "<server name>" 
  New-AzSqlServer -ServerName $serverName -ResourceGroupName $serverResourceGroupName -Location $serverLocation
  ```

4. Create a server firewall rule that allows access from the specified IP range
  
  ```powershell
  # The ip address range that you want to allow to access your server
  $startIp = "..."
  $endIp = "..."
  $serverFirewallRule = New-AzSqlServerFirewallRule -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -ServerName $serverName `
    -FirewallRuleName "AllowedIPs" -StartIpAddress $startIp -EndIpAddress $endIp
  ```

5. Assign a managed system identity to your server. You will need it later to grant your server access to Microsoft Azure Attestation.

  ```powershell
  Set-AzSqlServer -ServerName $serverName -ResourceGroupName $serverResourceGroupName -AssignIdentity 
  ```

6. Retrieve an object id of the identity assigned to your server. Save the resulting object id. You will need it for the steps in a later section.

  > [!NOTE]
  > It might take a few seconds for the newly assigned managed system identity to propagate in Azure Active Directory. If the below script commands return an empty result, retry them.

  ```PowerShell
  $server = Get-AzSqlServer -ServerName $serverName -ResourceGroupName $serverResourceGroupName 
  $serverObjectId = $server.Identity.PrincipalId
  $serverObjectId
  ```

7. Create a DC-series database.

  ```powershell
  $databaseName = "ContosoHR"
  $edition = "GeneralPurpose"
  $vCore = 2
  $generation = "DC"
  New-AzSqlDatabase -ResourceGroupName $serverResourceGroupName -ServerName $serverName -DatabaseName $databaseName -Edition $edition -Vcore $vCore -ComputeGeneration $generation
  ```

## Step 2: Configure an attestation provider

In this step, you will create an configure an attestation provider in Microsoft Azure Attestation. You will need to later to attest the secure enclave in your database server.

1. Copy the below attestation policy and save the above policy in a text file, for example, by using a text editor. For information about the below policy, see [Create and configure an attestation provider](encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves-sqldbmi-configure-attestation.md#create-and-configure-an-attestation-provider).

  ```sql
  version= 1.0;
  authorizationrules 
  {
       [ type=="$is-debuggable", value==false ]
        && [ type=="$product-id", value==4639 ]
        && [ type=="$svn", value>= 0 ]
        && [ type=="$sgx-mrsigner", value=="e31c9e505f37a58de09335075fc8591254313eb20bb1a27e5443cc450b6e33e5"] 
    => permit();
  };
  ```

2. Import the required versions of Az.Accounts and Az.Attestation.  

  ```powershell
  Import-Module "Az.Accounts" -MinimumVersion "1.9.2"
  Import-Module "Az.Attestation" -MinimumVersion "0.1.8"
  ```

3. Create a resource group for the attestation provider.

  ```powershell
  $attestationLocation = $serverLocation
  $attestationResourceGroupName = "<attestation provider resource group name>"
  New-AzResourceGroup -Name $attestationResourceGroupName -Location $location  
  ```

4. Create an attestation provider. 

  ```powershell
  $attestationProviderName = "<attestation provider name>" 
  New-AzAttestation -Name $attestationProviderName -ResourceGroupName $attestationResourceGroupName -Location $attestationLocation
  ```

5. Configure your attestation policy.
  
  ```powershell
  $policyFile = "<a pathname of the file from step 1 in this section"
  $teeType = "SgxEnclave"
  $policyFormat = "Text"
  $policy=Get-Content -path $policyFile -Raw
  Set-AzAttestationPolicy -Name $attestationProviderName -ResourceGroupName $attestationResourceGroupName -Tee $teeType -Policy $policy -PolicyFormat  $policyFormat
  ```

6. Grant your Azure SQL database server access to your attestation provider. Note that in this step, we are using the object id of the managed service identity, you assigned to your server earlier.

  ```powershell
  New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $serverObjectId -RoleDefinitionName "Attestation Reader" -ResourceGroupName $attestationResourceGroupName  
  ```

9. Retrieve an attestation URL.

  ```powershell
  $attestationProvider = Get-AzAttestation -Name $attestationProviderName -ResourceGroupName $attestationResourceGroupName 
  $attestationUrl = $attestationProvider.AttestUri + “/attest/SgxEnclave?api-version=2018-09-01-preview”
  Write-Host "Your attestation URL is: " $attestationUrl 
  ```

10.	Save the resulting attestation URL that points to an attestation policy you configured for SGX enclaves. You will need it later. The attestation URL should look like this: `https://contososqlattestation.uks.attest.azure.net/attest/SgxEnclave?api-version=201 8-09-01-preview`

## Step 3: Populate your database

In this step, you will create a table and populate it with some data, you will later encrypt and query.

1. Open SSMS and connect to the ContosoHR database in the Azure SQL database server you created **without** Always Encrypted enabled in the database connection.
    1. In the **Connect to Server** dialog, specify your server name (for example, myserver123.database.windows.net), and enter the user name and the password, you configured earlier.
    2. Click **Options >>** and select the **Connection Properties** tab. Make sure to select the **ContosoHR** database (not the default, master database). 
    3. Select the **Always Encrypted** tab.
    4. Make sure the **Enable Always Encrypted (column encryption)** checkbox is **not** selected.
    5. Click **Connect**.
    6. If you are prompted to enable Parameterization for Always Encrypted queries, select **Enable**.

2. Create a new table, named **Employees**.

    ```sql
    CREATE SCHEMA [HR];
    GO

    CREATE TABLE [HR].[Employees]
    (
        [EmployeeID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
        [SSN] [char](11) NOT NULL,
        [FirstName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
        [LastName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
        [Salary] [money] NOT NULL
    ) ON [PRIMARY];
    GO
    ```

3. Add a few employee records to the **Employees** table.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO [HR].[Employees]
            ([SSN]
            ,[FirstName]
            ,[LastName]
            ,[Salary])
        VALUES
            ('795-73-9838'
            , N'Catherine'
            , N'Abel'
            , $31692);

    INSERT INTO [dbo].[Employees]
            ([SSN]
            ,[FirstName]
            ,[LastName]
            ,[Salary])
        VALUES
            ('990-00-6818'
            , N'Kim'
            , N'Abercrombie'
            , $55415);
    ```


## Step 4: Provision enclave-enabled keys

In this step, you will create a column master key and a column encryption key that allow enclave computations.

1. Using the SSMS instance from the previous step, in **Object Explorer**, expand your database and navigate to **Security** > **Always Encrypted Keys**.
1. Provision a new enclave-enabled column master key:
    1. Right-click **Always Encrypted Keys** and select **New Column Master Key...**.
    2. Select your column master key name: **CMK1**.
    3. Make sure you select either **Windows Certificate Store (Current User or Local Machine)** or **Azure Key Vault**.
    4. Select **Allow enclave computations**.
    5. If you selected Azure Key Vault, sign in to Azure and select your key vault. For more information on how to create a key vault for Always Encrypted, see [Manage your key vaults from Azure portal](/archive/blogs/kv/manage-your-key-vaults-from-new-azure-portal).
    6. Select your certificate or Azure Key Value key if it already exists, or click the **Generate Certificate** button to create a new one.
    7. Select **OK**.

        ![Allow enclave computations](encryption/media/always-encrypted-enclaves/allow-enclave-computations.png)

1. Create a new enclave-enabled column encryption key:

    1. Right-click **Always Encrypted Keys** and select **New Column Encryption Key**.
    2. Enter a name for the new column encryption key: **CEK1**.
    3. In the **Column master key** dropdown, select the column master key you created in the previous steps.
    4. Select **OK**.

## Step 5: Encrypt some columns in place

In this step, you will encrypt the data stored in the **SSN** and **Salary** columns inside the server-side enclave, and then test a SELECT query on the data.

1. Open a new SSMS instance and connect to your database **with** Always Encrypted enabled for the database connection.
    1. Start a new instance of SSMS.
    2. In the **Connect to Server** dialog, specify your server name, select an authentication method and specify your credentials.
    3. Click **Options >>** and select the **Connection Properties** tab. Make sure to select the **ContosoHR** database (not the default, master database). 
    4. Select the **Always Encrypted** tab.
    5. Make sure the **Enable Always Encrypted (column encryption)** checkbox is selected.
    6. Specify your enclave attestation URL, you've obtained by following the steps in [Step 2: Configure an attestation provider](#step-2-configure-an-attestation-provider).
    7. Select **Connect**.
    8. If you are prompted to enable Parameterization for Always Encrypted queries, select **Enable**.

1. Using the same SSMS instance (with Always Encrypted enabled), open a new query window and encrypt the **SSN** and **Salary** columns by running the below queries.

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
    ALTER COLUMN [SSN] [char] (11) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2
    ENCRYPTED WITH (COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1], ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized, ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL
    WITH
    (ONLINE = ON);

    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
    ALTER COLUMN [Salary] [money]
    ENCRYPTED WITH (COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1], ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized, ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL
    WITH
    (ONLINE = ON);

    ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Notice the ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE statement to clear the query plan cache for the database in the above script. After you have altered the table, you need to clear the plans for all batches and stored procedures that access the table, to refresh parameters encryption information. 

1. To verify the **SSN** and **Salary** columns are now encrypted, open a new query window in the SSMS instance **without** Always Encrypted enabled for the database connection and execute the below statement. The query window should return encrypted values in the **SSN** and **Salary** columns. If you execute the same query using the SSMS instance with Always Encrypted enabled, you should see the data decrypted.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Employees];
    ```

## Step 6: Run rich queries against encrypted columns

Now, you can run rich queries against the encrypted columns. Some query processing will be performed inside your server-side enclave. 

1. In the SSMS instance **with** Always Encrypted enabled, make sure Parameterization for Always Encrypted is also enabled.
    1. Select **Tools** from the main menu of SSMS.
    2. Select **Options...**.
    3. Navigate to **Query Execution** > **SQL Server** > **Advanced**.
    4. Ensure that **Enable Parameterization for Always Encrypted** is checked.
    5. Select **OK**.
2. Open a new query window, paste in and execute the below query. The query should return plaintext values and rows meeting the specified search criteria.

    ```sql
    DECLARE @SSNPattern [char](11) = '%6818';
    DECLARE @MinSalary [money] = $1000;
    SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Employees]
    WHERE SSN LIKE @SSNPattern AND [Salary] >= @MinSalary;
    ```

3. Try the same query again in the SSMS instance that does not have Always Encrypted enabled, and note the failure that occurs.
