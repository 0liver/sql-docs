# sys.dm_workload_management_workload_groups_stats (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-xxxx-asdw-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-xxxx-asdw-xxx-md.md)]

  Displays wait information for all resource types in [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../includes/sssdw-md.md)].  
  
|Column Name|Data Type|Description|Range|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|  
|group_id|**int**|Unique ID of the workload group. Is not nullable.||
|name|**sysname**|Name of the workload group. Is not nullable.||
|statistics_start_time|**datetime**|Time that statistics collection was reset for the workload group. Is not nullable.||
|total_request_count|**bigint**|Cumulative count of completed requests in the workload group. Is not nullable.||
|total_shared_resource_reqeusts|**bigint**|Cumulative count of completed requests in the workload group that used resources from the shared pool.  Is not nullable.||
|total_queued_request_count|**bigint**|Cumulative count of requests queued after the max_concurrency limit was reached. Is not nullable.||
|total_request_execution_timeouts|**bigint**|Cumulative count of requests in the workload group that timed out before completion based on the query_execution_timeout_sec setting.||
|effective_min_percentage_resource|**tinyint**|The effective min_percentage_resource setting allowed considering the service level and the workload group settings. The effective min_percentage_resource can be adjusted higher on lower service levels.  For example, on DW100c, the lowest min_percentage_resource allowable is 25%.
Is not nullable.||
|effective_cap_percentage_resource|**tinyint**|The effective cap_percentage_resource for the workload group.  If there are other workload groups with min_percentage_resource > 0, the effective_cap_percentage_resource is lowered proportionally.||
|effective_request_min_resource_grant_percent|**decimal(5,2)**|The effective runtime value for request_min_resource_grant_percent of the workload group. The effective value considering the service level and how the workload group is configured.  If min_percentage_resource is adjusted because of the service level, effective_request_min_resource_grant_percent will be adjusted accordingly. Is not nullable.||
|effective_request_max_resource_grant_percent|**decimal(5,2)**|The effective runtime value for request_max_resource_grant_percent of the workload group considering the configuration of the all workload groups.  Is not nullable.||
