## Explanation  
This error occurs when [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has failed to allocate sufficient memory to run a query. This can be caused by various reasons including operating system settings, physical memory availability, too many other components using memory inside SQL Server, or memory limits on the current workload. In most cases, the transaction that failed is not the cause of this error. Overall, the caused can be grouped into three:

### External or OS memory pressure
  External pressure refers high memory utilizaton coming from a component outside of the SQL Server process. This means, you have to find if other applications on the system are consuming memory and leading to low memory availability. SQL Server is one of the very few applications written to respond to OS memory pressure by cutting back its memory use.This means, if some application or driver asks for memory, the OS sends a signal to everyone to free up memory and SQL Server will respond by reducing its own memory usage. Very few applications respond because they are not designed to listen for that notification. SQL Server is designed this way. So if SQL starts cutting back its memory usage, itâ€™s memory pool is reduced and whichever components need memory may not get it. You start getting 701 and other memory-related errors.

> [!NOTE]
> On PaaS systems like Azure SQL Database it is very difficult for you to diagnose external pressure since such metrics are not exposed

### Internal memory pressure, not coming from SQL Server

Internal memory pressure refers to low memory availability inside the SQL Server process. But there are components that may run inside the SQL Server process that are "external" to the SQL Server engine and yet run inside the SQL Server process. Examples include DLLs like Linked Servers, SQLCLR components, Extended procedures (XPs), OLE Automation (sp_OA*). Others include anti-virus or other security programs that inject DLLs inside a process for monitoring purposes. A issue or poor design in any of these components could lead to large memory consumption. For example, think of a linked server caching 20 million rows of data that come from an external source into SQL Server memory. As far as SQL Server is concerned, no memory clerk will report high memory usage, but memory consumed inside the SQL Server process will be high. This memory growth from a linked server DLL, for example, would cause SQL Server to start cutting its memory usage (see above) and will create low-memory conditions of for components inside SQL Server, causing errors like 701.

### Internal memory pressure, coming from SQL Server component(s)
  
Internal memory pressure coming from components inside SQL Server Engine can also lead to error 701. There are hundreds of components, tracked via [memory clerks](../system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-memory-clerks-transact-sql.md), that allocate memory in SQL Server. You must identify which memory clerk(s) are responsible for the majority of memory allocations to be able to resolve this further. For example, if you find that the OBJECTSTORE_LOCK_MANAGER memory clerk is showing the large memory allocation, you need to further understand why the Lock Manager is consuming so much memory. You may find there are query requests that apply a large number of locks and optimize them by using indexes, or perhaps long transactions take place that cause locks not to be released for long periods in certain isolation levels, or perhaps lock escalation is disabled. Each memory clerk or component has a unique way of accessing and using memory. For more information, see [memory clerk types](../system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-memory-clerks-transact-sql.md) and their descriptions.

## User action  

If you are not using Resource Governor, we recommend that you verify the overall server state and load, or check the resource pool or workload group settings.  

If error 701 appears occasionally or for a very brief period, there may be a short-lived memory issue that resolved itself. You may not need to take action in those cases. However, if the error occurs multiple times, on multiple connections and persists for periods of seconds or longer, follow the steps to troubleshoot further.

The following list outlines general steps that will help in troubleshooting memory errors:  

### External pressure: diagnostics and solutions

- To diagnose low memory conditions on the system outside of SQL Server process, collect Performance monitor counters. Investigate if applications or services other than SQL Server are consuming memory on this server by looking at these counters:

  -  **Memory:Available MB**
  -  **Process:Working Set**
  - **Process:Private Bytes**

- Review the System Event and look for memory related errors (e.g. low virtual memory). Review the Application Event log for application-related memory issues.
- Address any code or configuration issues for less critical applications or services to reduce their memory usage.  
- If applications besides [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are consuming resources, try stopping running these applications or consider running them on a separate server. These steps will remove external memory pressure.

### Internal memory pressure, not coming from SQL Server

To diagnose internal memory pressure caused by DLLs running inside SQL Server, there are a couple of ways to approach it:

- If SQL Server is *not* using Locked Pages in Memory (AWE API), then majority of its memory is reflected in **Process:Private Bytes** counter for the SQLServr instance in Performance Monitor. The overall memory usage coming from within SQL Server engine is reflected in **SQL Server:Memory Manager: Total Server Memory (KB)** counter. If you find a significant difference between the value **Process:Private Bytes** and **SQL Server:Memory Manager: Total Server Memory (KB)**, then that difference is likely coming from an DLL (linked server, XP, SQLCLR, etc.). For example if Private bytes is 300 GB and Total Server Memory counter is 250 GB, then 50 GB of the overall memory in the process is coming from outside SQL Server engine.
- If SQL Server is using Locked Pages in Memory (AWE API), then it is more challenging to identify the issue because Performance monitor does not offer AWE counters that track memory usage for individual processes. The overall memory usage coming from within SQL Server engine is reflected in **SQL Server:Memory Manager: Total Server Memory (KB)** counter and typical **Process:Private Bytes** values may vary between 300 MB and 1-2 GB overall. If you find a significant usage of **Process:Private Bytes** beyond the typical use, then the difference is likely coming from an DLL (linked server, XP, SQLCLR, etc.). For example if Private bytes is 5-4 GB and SQL Server is using Locked Pages in Memory (AWE), then a large part of the Private bytes may be coming from outside SQL Server engine. This is more of an approximation technique. 

- Use Tasklist to identify any DLLs that are loaded inside SQL Server space 
 
  ```console
   tasklist /M /FI "IMAGENAME eq sqlservr.exe"
  ```

- You could also use this query to examine loaded modules (DLLs) and see if something is not expected to be there

  ```tsql
  SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_loaded_modules
  ```

- If you suspect that a Linked Server DLL is causing a significant memory consumption, then you can configure it to run out of process by disabling **Allow inprocess** option. See [Create Linked Servers](../linked-servers/create-linked-servers-sql-server-database-engine.md) for more information. Note that not all linked server OLEDB providers may run out of process; contact the product manufacturer for more information. 
- In the rare cases when OLE automation objects are used (sp_OA*), you can configure the object to be running outside SQL process by setting *context* = 4 (Local (.exe) OLE server only.). For more information, see [sp_OACreate](../system-stored-procedures/sp-oacreate-transact-sql.md)

### Internal memory usage by SQL Server engine: diagnostics and solutions

- Start collecting performance monitor counters for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:**Buffer Manager**, **SQL Server: Memory Manager**.  
- Query the SQL Server memory clerks DMV multiple times to see where the highest consumption of memory is inside the engine and see if it changes:

  ```tsql
  SELECT pages_kb, type, name, virtual_memory_committed_kb, awe_allocated_kb
  FROM sys.dm_os_memory_clerks
  ORDER BY pages_kb DESC
  ```

- Alternatively, you can observe the more detailed DBCC MEMORYSTATUS output and the way it changes when you see these error messages.  

  ```tsql
  DBCC MEMORYSTATUS
  ```

- If you identify a clear offender among the memory clerks, focus on addressing the specifics of memory consumption for that component. Here are several examples:

  - If MEMORYCLERK_SQLQERESERVATIONS is consuming memory you may need to identify queries that are using huge memory grants and optimize them (indexes) , re-write them (remove ORDER by , e.g), or apply query hints
  - If a large number of ad-hoc query plans are cached the CACHESTORE_SQLCP memory clerk would use large amount of memory. Identify queries non-parameterized queries whose plans cannot be reused and parameterize them by converting to stored procs, or by using sp_executesql, or use FORCED parameterization.
  - If object plan cache CACHESTORE_OBJCP is consuming lots of memory, identify which stored proc, functions, triggers are using lots of memory and possibly redesign the application. Commonly this may happen due to large amounts of database or schemas with hundreds of procs in each database.
  - If OBJECTSTORE_LOCK_MANAGER memory clerk is showing the large memory allocation, identify queries  that apply a large number of locks and optimize them by using indexes; or long transactions may be taking place that cause locks not to be released for long periods in certain isolation levels, or perhaps lock escalation is disabled


## Quick relief that may make memory available

The following actions may free some memory and make it available to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  

- Check the following SQL Server memory configuration parameters and consider increasing **max server memory** if possible:  
  
    -   **max server memory**  
    -   **min server memory**  
  
    Notice unusual settings. Correct them as necessary. Account for increased memory requirements. Default settings are listed in [Server memory configuration options](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-memory-server-configuration-options.md).
  
- If you have not configured **max server memory** especially with Locked Pages in Memory, consider setting to a particular value to allow some memory for the OS.

- Check the query workload for example, number of concurrent sessions, currently executing queries and see if there are some less critical applications that may be stopped temporarily or moved to another server.

- If you are running SQL Server in a virtual machine (VM) check to ensure the memory for each VM is not overcommitted. For example, see this blog [Virtualization â€“ Overcommitting memory and how to detect it within the VM](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/running-sap-applications-on-the/virtualization-8211-overcommitting-memory-and-how-to-detect-it/ba-p/367623) and  [Troubleshooting ESX/ESXi virtual machine performance issues (memory overcommitment)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2001003#Memory) 


- You can run the following DBCC commands to free several [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] memory caches.  
  
-   DBCC FREESYSTEMCACHE
  
-   DBCC FREESESSIONCACHE  
  
-   DBCC FREEPROCCACHE  
  
- If the problem continues, you will need to investigate further and possibly increase server resources (RAM).
