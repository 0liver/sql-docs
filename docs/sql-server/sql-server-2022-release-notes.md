# [!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2022](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] release notes

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2022](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2022.md)]

This article describes requirements, limitations and known issues for the [!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2022](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] community technology preview (CTP) 2.1.

Complete details about licensing are in `License Terms` folder on the installation media.

## Hardware and software requirements

This release has the same hardware and software requirements as [SQL Server 2019](install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server-2019.md), except as noted below:

- .NET Framework: 4.7.2. [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472).

## Feature notes

This section identifies known issues you may experience with this product:

1. Certain SSIS functions require the [Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server](../connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md) and [Microsoft OLE DB Driver 19 for SQL Server](../connect/oledb/download-oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md), which are not packaged in SQL Server 2022 CTP2.1 installation. For CTP2.1, please install the two drivers from the provided links as necessary. The new drivers will be installed by later versions of SQL Server 2022.
