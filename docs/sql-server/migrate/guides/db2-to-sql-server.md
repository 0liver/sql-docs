[!INCLUDE[sqlserver](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]


## Prerequisites

To migrate your DB2 database to SQL Server, you need:

- [SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for DB2](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54254)


## Pre-migration

Before you begin your migration, discover the topology of your environment and assess the feasibility of your intended migration.

### Discover

The goal of the Discover phase is to identify existing data sources and details about the features that are being used to get a better understanding of and plan for the migration. This process involves scanning your network to identify all your organizationâ€™s DB2 instances together with the version and features in use.

### Assess and convert

Create an assessment using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA). 

To create an assessment, follow these steps:

1. Open SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for DB2. 
1. Select **File** and then choose **New Project**. 
1. Provide a project name, a location to save your project, and then select a SQL Server migration target from the drop-down. 
1. Select **OK**.
