    questions:
      - question: Can I exclude instances when I onboard with Azure Policy with Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server? 
        answer: |
          Yes, you can set the `excludedInstances` setting in the Azure Policy.  
          
          For example, if you have standby instances, perhaps you don't want to see them in the portal. When you use Azure Policy to onboard, you can exclude instances based on a pattern in the name. 

          1. Create a copy of the definition that we provide in Azure so that you can create a custom definition.
          1. Set the value for excluded instances in the custom definition.
          1. Target the subscription and resource group.

      - question: Is data from my instance of SQL Server sent to Azure.
        answer: |
           No. Microsoft only captures metadata and information to help troubleshoot. This does not include user data or how SQL Server is being utilized.
