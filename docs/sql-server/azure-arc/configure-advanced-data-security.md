# Protect Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server with Microsoft Defender for Cloud 

You can configure your instance connected to Azure with Microsoft Defender for Cloud by following these steps.

## Prerequisites

- Your Windows-based SQL Server instance is connected to Azure. Follow the instructions to [onboard your SQL Server instance to Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server](connect.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Microsoft Defender for Cloud is only supported for SQL Server instances on Windows machines. This will not work for SQL Server on Linux machines.

- Your user account is assigned one of the [Security Center Roles (RBAC)](/azure/security-center/security-center-permissions)

## Create a Log Analytics workspace

1. Search for **Log Analytics workspaces** resource type and add a new one through the creation pane.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can use a Log Analytics workspace in any region so if you already have one, you can use it. But we recommend creating it in the same region where your Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server resource is created.

1. Go to __Agents management > Log Analytics agent instructions__  and copy Workspace ID and Primary key for later use.

## Install Log Analytics Agent

The next step is needed only if you haven't yet configured MMA on the remote machine.

1. Go to __Azuree Arc > Servers__ and open  the Azure Arc-enabled server resource for the machine where the SQL Server instance is installed. 

1. Open the **Extensions** blade and click __+ Add__. 

1. Select __Log Analytics Agent - Azure Arc__ and click __Next__. 

1. Set the Workspace ID and Workspace key using the values you saved in the previous step.

1. After validation succeeds, select **Create** to install the agent. When the deployment completes, the status updates to *Succeeded*.

For more information, see [Extension management with Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/servers/manage-vm-extensions).

## Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud

1. Go to __Azuree Arc > SQL Servers__ and open  the Azure Arc-enabled SQL server resource for the instance that you want to protect. 

1. Click on the __Microsoft Defender for Cloud__ tile and then on __Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud__.

1. Follow the steps documented in [Enable Microsoft Defender for SQL servers on machines](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-usage#set-up-microsoft-defender-for-sql-servers-on-machines)..
 
> [!NOTE]
   > The first scan to generate the vulnerability assessment happens within 24 hours after enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud. After that, auto scans are be performed every week on Sunday.

## Explore

Explore security anomalies and threats in Azure Security Center.

1. Open your SQL Server â€“ Azure Arc resource and select **Security** in the left menu. to see the recommendations and alerts for that instance.

1. Select any of the recommendations to see the vulnerability details in **Security Center**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/configure-advanced-data-security/vulnerabilities-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Vulnerability report.":::

1. Select any security alert for full details and further explore the attack in [Azure Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/overview). The following diagram is an example of the brute force alert.

1. Select **Take action** to mitigate the alert.

> [!NOTE]
> The general **Security Center** link at the top of the page does not use the preview portal URL so your **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resources are not be visible there. Follow the links for the individual recommendations or alerts.

## Next steps

- You can further investigate the security alerts and attacks using [Azure Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/overview). For details, see [on-board Azure Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/connect-data-sources).
