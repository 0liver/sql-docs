In the coming months any deployments with extensions from the June 2024 release (1.1.2717.190) or greater will automatically have least privilege configuration applied.

To prevent automatic application of least privilege, block extension upgrades to version 1.1.2717.190 or later.

Beginning with the August 2024 release, the agent will automatically have the least privilege configuration.
