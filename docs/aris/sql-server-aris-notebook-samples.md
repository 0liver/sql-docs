# Notebook samples for SQL Server vNext

TBD

## Options for this article and Samples section

If we have a location of runnable notebooks, we can either:

- Make this an index topic to notebooks to try with a description of how to get them. The notebooks themselves can be documented on how to use them within the notebook.
- Make a tutorial per notebook sample that allows you walk through using the notebook a little more hands on. We could still have this topic be an index to the tutorial topics (which might not appear in the TOC).
- Or, if we could remove the samples section for now and just highlight samples in other topics within the content set.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After we make a decision, we can remove this content and replace with target content for CTP 2.0.
