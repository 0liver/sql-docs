# Deploy an SSIS project with PowerShell
This quickstart demonstrates how to use a PowerShell script to connect to a database server and deploy an SSIS project to the SSIS Catalog.

## Prerequisites

An Azure SQL Database server listens on port 1433. If you're trying to connect to an Azure SQL Database server from within a corporate firewall, this port must be open in the corporate firewall for you to connect successfully.

## Supported platforms

You can use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS project to the following platforms:

-   SQL Server on Windows.

-   Azure SQL Database. For more info about deploying and running packages in Azure, see [Lift and shift SQL Server Integration Services workloads to the cloud](lift-shift/ssis-azure-lift-shift-ssis-packages-overview.md).

You cannot use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS package to SQL Server on Linux. For more info about running packages on Linux, see [Extract, transform, and load data on Linux with SSIS](../linux/sql-server-linux-migrate-ssis.md).

## PowerShell script
Provide appropriate values for the variables at the top of the following script, and then run the script to deploy the SSIS project.

> [!NOTE]
> The following example uses Windows Authentication to deploy to a SQL Server on premises. To use SQL Server authentication, replace the `Integrated Security=SSPI;` argument with `User ID=<user name>;Password=<password>;`. If you're connecting to an Azure SQL Database server, you can't use Windows authentication.

```powershell
# Variables
$SSISNamespace = "Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.IntegrationServices"
$TargetServerName = "localhost"
$TargetFolderName = "Project1Folder"
$ProjectFilePath = "C:\Projects\Integration Services Project1\Integration Services Project1\bin\Development\Integration Services Project1.ispac"
$ProjectName = "Integration Services Project1"

# Load the IntegrationServices assembly
$loadStatus = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load("Microsoft.SQLServer.Management.IntegrationServices, "+
    "Version=14.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845dcd8080cc91, processorArchitecture=MSIL")

# Create a connection to the server
$sqlConnectionString = `
    "Data Source=" + $TargetServerName + ";Initial Catalog=master;Integrated Security=SSPI;"
$sqlConnection = New-Object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection $sqlConnectionString

# Create the Integration Services object
$integrationServices = New-Object $SSISNamespace".IntegrationServices" $sqlConnection

# Get the Integration Services catalog
$catalog = $integrationServices.Catalogs["SSISDB"]

# Create the target folder
$folder = New-Object $SSISNamespace".CatalogFolder" ($catalog, $TargetFolderName,
    "Folder description")
$folder.Create()

Write-Host "Deploying " $ProjectName " project ..."

# Read the project file and deploy it
[byte[]] $projectFile = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($ProjectFilePath)
$folder.DeployProject($ProjectName, $projectFile)

Write-Host "Done."
```
