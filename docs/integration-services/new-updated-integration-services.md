# New and Recently Updated: Integration Services for SQL Server



Nearly every day Microsoft updates some of its existing articles on its [Docs.Microsoft.com](http://docs.microsoft.com/) documentation website. This article displays excerpts from recently updated articles. Links to new articles might also be listed.

This article is generated by a program that is rerun periodically. Occasionally an excerpt can appear with imperfect formatting, or as markdown from the source article. Images are never displayed here.

Recent updates are reported for the following date range and subject:



- *Date range of updates:* &nbsp; **2017-05-17** &nbsp; -to- &nbsp; **2017-06-30**

## Updated Articles with Excerpts

This section displays the excerpts of updates gathered from articles which have recently experienced a large update.

The excerpts displayed here appear separated from their proper semantic context. Also, sometimes an excerpt is separated from important markdown syntax that surrounds it in the actual article. Therefore these excerpts are for general guidance only. The excerpts only enable you to know whether your interests warrant taking the time to click and visit the actual article.

For these and other reasons, do not copy code from these excerpts, and do not take as exact truth any text excerpt. Instead, visit the actual article.

**Permissions Required to Deploy SSIS Projects and Packages**


If you change the SSIS service account from the default, you may have to give additional permissions to the non-default service account before you can deploy packages successfully. If the non-default service account doesn't have the required permissions, you may see the following error message.

*A .NET Framework error occurred during execution of user-defined routine or aggregate "deploy_project_internal":
System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: A required privilege is not held by the client.*

This error is typically the result of missing DCOM permissions. To fix the error, do the following things.

1.  Open the **Component Services** console (or run Dcomcnfg.exe).
2.  In the **Component Services** console, expand **Component Services** > **Computers** > **My Computer** > **DCOM Config**.
3.  In the list, locate **Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services xx.0** for the version of SQL Server that you're using. For example, SQL Server 2016 is version 13.
4.  Right-click and select **Properties**.
5.  In the **Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services 13.0 Properties** dialog box, select the **Security** tab.
6.  For each of the three sets of permissions - Launch and Activation, Access, and Configuration - select **Customize**, then select **Edit** to open the **Permission** dialog box.
7.  In the **Permission** dialog box, add the non-default service account and grant **Allow** permissions as required. Typically, an account has **Local Launch** and **Local Activation** permissions.
8.  Click **OK** twice, then close the **Component Services** console.

For more info about the error described in this section and about the permissions required by the SSIS service account, see the following blog post.

**New in SSIS in SQL Server 2017 CTP 2.1**


**New features in Scale Out for SSIS**


1.	You can now use the **Use32BitRuntime** parameter when you trigger execution in Scale Out.
2.	The performance of logging to SSISDB for package executions in Scale Out has been improved. The Event Message and Message Context logs are now written to SSISDB in batch mode instead of one by one. Here are some additional notes about this improvement:        
    - Some reports in the current version of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) don't currently display these logs for executions in Scale Out. We anticipate that they will be supported in the next release of SSMS. The affected reports include the *All Connections* report, the *Error Context* report, and the *Connection Information* section in the Integration Service Dashboard.
    - A new column **event_message_guid** has been added. Use this column to join the [catalog].[event_message_context] view and the [catalog].[event_messages] view instead of using **event_message_id** when you query these logs of executions in Scale Out.

**New in SSIS in SQL Server 2017 CTP 2.0**
