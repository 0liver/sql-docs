# Support for Report Viewer current branch versions

**_Applies to: Microsoft Report Viewer version 150.900.148_**

We plan to release updates for the **Report Viewer control** on an as needed basis. Starting with the current version of Report Viewer, there's no version patching and all fixes are rolled-forward. There's technical support for the current version of Report Viewer only.  The current version is always in the **Security and Critical Updates** servicing phase. When running the current version of the Report Viewer control, you receive both Security and Critical Updates.

>[!Note]
>This support statement means that if you encounter a code defect that warrants a critical update, you must have the latest version installed to receive a fix. We will provide at least 12 months advance notice of deprecation of any features.  Older versions of the Report Viewer are maintained and available through nuget.

For a version history of the Report Viewer control, see the following links:

- [Windows Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ReportingServices.ReportViewerControl.Winforms/)
- [ASP.Net Web Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ReportingServices.ReportViewerControl.WebForms/)
