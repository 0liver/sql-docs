# Monitoring overview
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]

If you're using Azure Analysis Services, see [Monitor server metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-monitor) and [Setup diagnostic logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-logging).

  You can monitor the performance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] or Performance Monitor, an application sometimes referred to as **PerfMon**. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] lets you create and manage traces and analyze and replay trace results. Performance Monitor reports on server status, as indexed through certain counters, which are discussed in the next section.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For more information about monitoring, see the [SQL Server 2008 R2 Operations Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=225539).
