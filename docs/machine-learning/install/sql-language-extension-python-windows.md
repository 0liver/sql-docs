# Install custom runtime language extension for Python for Windows

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2019 and later](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

>[!Note]
>Python custom runtime language extension runs on SQL Server 2019 CU3 or later
 
This article describes how to install the language extension for running Python scripts with [SQL Server for Windows.](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server.md)

The language extension can be used with the following scenarios:

+ An installation of SQL Server with extensibility framework.

+ An installation of SQL Machine Learning Services for SQL Server 2019. The language extension can be used with [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../sql-server-machine-learning-services.md) after completing some additional configuration steps.

+ [SQL Server Language Extensions on Windows with the extensibility framework.](../../language-extensions/install/install-sql-server-language-extensions-on-windows.md)

+ [Python3.7]( https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/)

## Add custom runtime language extension

>[!Note]
>For Machine Learning Services using SQL Server 2019, **mssql-server-extensibility is already installed.**

Language Extensions use the extensibility framework for executing external code. Code execution is isolated from the core engine processes, but fully integrated with SQL Server query execution.

Complete the setup for SQL Server 2019.

1. Start the setup wizard for SQL Server 2019. 
  
1. On the **Installation** tab, select **New SQL Server stand-alone installation or add features to an existing installation**.
    
    ![SQL Server 2019 CU3 or later installation](../install/media/2019setup-installation-page-mlsvcs.png) 

1. On the **Feature Selection** page, select these options:
  
    - **Database Engine Services**
  
        To use Language Extensions with SQL Server, you must install an instance of the database engine. You can use either a default or a named instance.
  
    - **Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions**
   
       Select **Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions** Python isn't selected.

    ![SQL Server 2019 CU3 or later installation features](../install/media/sql-feature-selection.png) 

1. On the **Ready to Install** page, verify that these selections are included, and select **Install**.
  
    + Database Engine Services
    + Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions

    Note of the location of the folder under the path `..\Setup Bootstrap\Log` where the configuration files are stored. When setup is complete, you can review the installed components in the Summary file.

1. After setup is complete, if you're instructed to restart the computer, do so now. It's important to read the message from the Installation Wizard when you've finished with Setup. For more information, see [View and Read SQL Server Setup Log Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/install-windows/view-and-read-sql-server-setup-log-files).


## Install Python 3.7 

[Complete installation of Python 3.7 and add to path.]( https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/)

![Add Python 3.7 to path.](../install/media/python-379.png) update image - note

+ Install [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package for Python 3.7

```bash
python.exe -m pip install pandas
```

## Enable external script execution in SQL Server

An external script in R can be executed via the stored procedure [sp_execute_external script](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md) run again SQL Server.Â Execute the following script using [Azure Data Studio.](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio)


```sql
sp_configure 'external scripts enabled', 1;
RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE;  
```
## Download language extension

**GitHub link goes here**

## Update environment path for Windows

Add PYTHONHOME as an environment variable. Path modified during installation. For example: C:\Python3.7 install directory.
![Create PYTHONHOME system variable.](../install/media/sys-pythonhome.png)

>[!Note] 
>For SQL Machine Learning Services a new path for the language extension will need to be created.

## Create external language

Use Azure Data Studio to connect to SQL Server.
Modify the path to reflect the location of the download.

>[!Note] 
>Python is a reserved word. It can't be used as a name for the external Python language extension.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE mypython 
FROM (CONTENT = N'C:\Users\username\pythonextension.zip', FILE_NAME = 'pythonextension.dll');
GO
```

## Verify language extension

This script tests the functionality of the installed language extension. Use Azure Data Studio to connect to SQL Server.

```sql
EXEC sp_execute_external_script
@language =N'mypython',
@script=N'
import sys
print(sys.path)
print(sys.version)
print(sys.executable)
```

## Verify parameters and datasets of different data types

This script tests the installed language extension functionality, such as the exchange of different data types for input, output parameters, and datasets.

```sql
exec sp_execute_external_script
@language = N'myPython',
@script = N'
import sys
print(''Hello PythonExtension!'');
OutputDataSet = InputDataSet;
print(InputDataSet);
print(OutputDataSet);
print(sys.version)',
@input_data_1 = N'select 1, cast(1.4 as real), ''Hi'', cast(''1'' as bit)'
WITH RESULT SETS ((intCol int, doubleCol real, charCol char(2), logicalCol bit))
```
