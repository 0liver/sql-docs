[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx](../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx.md)]

Gain near real-time insights from all your data with SQL Server 2019 [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ver15.md)], which provide a complete environment for working with large sets of data, including machine learning and AI capabilities.

This article lists the updates and known issues for the most recent releases of [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] (BDC).

## <a id="rtm"></a> SQL Server 2019

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] introduces [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md).

Use [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md) to:

- [Deploy scalable clusters](../big-data-cluster/deploy-get-started.md) of SQL Server, Spark, and HDFS containers running on Kubernetes. 
- Read, write, and process big data from Transact-SQL or Spark.
- Easily combine and analyze high-value relational data with high-volume big data.
- Query external data sources.
- Store big data in HDFS managed by SQL Server.
- Query data from multiple external data sources through the cluster.
- Use the data for AI, machine learning, and other analysis tasks.
- [Deploy and run applications](../big-data-cluster/concept-application-deployment.md) in [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-nover.md)].
- Virtualize data with [PolyBase](../relational-databases/polybase/polybase-guide.md). Query data from external SQL Server, Oracle, Teradata, MongoDB, and ODBC data sources with external tables.
- Provide high availability for the SQL Server master instance and all databases by using Always On availability group technology.
