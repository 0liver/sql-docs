# Microsoft Spark Runtime Guide

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

## Introducing the Microsoft Spark Runtime

The __Microsoft Spark Runtime__ is a standardized distribution specification for Apache Spark that enables seamless interoperability and shared experiences between Spark-based Microsoft data product offerings. This Spark runtime is a consistent, versioned block of programming language distributions, engine optimizations, core libraries, and packages.

Every product that uses this Spark runtime specification, will contain the same versions of Apache Spark Core, PySpark, Scala Spark, Spark.R, sparklyr, and .NET for Spark.

All the distributed packages and libraries are also the same. One of the primary goals for the specification is to provide a first-class experience for Data Engineers and Data Scientists by providing a constantly curated and updated list of packages and connectors, out-of-the-box.

Benefits of the Microsoft Spark Runtime:

1. Spark engine optimizations and features available on all products and services
1. Established release cadence
1. Seamless interoperability between Spark products and services
1. Curated packages for Data Engineers and Data Scientists
1. Consistent package management story

## The runtime and product offerings

[!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-nover](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] and [Azure Synapse Analytics](/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-version-support) implement the Microsoft Spark Runtime specification.

This means that under the same specific runtime release version, for example, you can migrate a PySpark notebook between SQL Server big data cluster and your Azure Synapse workspace Spark Pool with minor modifications. The PySpark version, Spark core, all libraries will be the same. Modifications in the code might be required regarding hard-coded file and folder paths. This applies to languages that are available on both offerings.

## Release cadence and naming standards

The Microsoft Spark Runtime specification defines the following:

* The naming standard is "Microsoft Spark __SPARK_MAJOR_VERSION__ Runtime __CALENDAR_YEAR__.__RELEASE#__".
* There may be many releases per calendar year. __RELEASE#__ is a sequential number (not bound to months or other standard). The expected cadence is at least twice a year.
* Once a runtime release is created, it is immutable. All components versions are locked in.
* A product, such as [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-nover](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)], will pick which runtime release it will ship in an update.
* Each product offering may have a different release cadence. For example, Azure Synapse may ship runtime releases more frequently.

## SQL Server Big Data Cluster and its runtime implementation

[!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-nover](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] will release runtime updates periodically.

1. [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-nover](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] will ship two runtime releases per year within its cumulative updates release cycle. It currently has six cumulative updates per calendar year, for example from CU14 to CU19; only two of those updates will contain a newer runtime release in order to provide a more stable cadence.
1. Standardized in at least six months between refreshing runtime releases.
1. A SQL Server big data cluster is tied to one runtime distribution at a specific cumulative update. It is not possible to run multiple runtime releases in the same cluster.

## What's in the current runtime release?

The [SQL Server Big Data Clusters platform release notes](release-notes-big-data-cluster.md) have the runtime name and complete contents of the release.
