# Troubleshooting Big Data Clusters (BDC) with notebooks

This page is an index of notebooks for SQL Server Big Data Clusters. Those executable notebooks (.ipynb) are designed for SQL Server 2019 to assist in troubleshooting Big Data Clusters.

Each notebook is designed to check for its own dependencies. A **Run all cells** will either complete successfully or will raise an exception with a hyperlinked hint to another notebook to resolve the missing dependency. Follow the hint hyperlink to the subsequent notebook, press **Run all cells**, and upon success return back to the original notebook, and **Run all cells**.

Once all dependencies are installed, but **Run all cells** fails, each notebook will analyze results and where possible, produce a hyperlinked hint to another notebook to further aid in resolving the issue.
