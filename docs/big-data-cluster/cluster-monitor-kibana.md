# Monitor applications with cluster with Kibana Dashboard

The `logsUrl` value links to a Kibana dashboard:

![Kibana dashboard](./media/view-cluster-status/kibana-dashboard.png)

> [!NOTE]
> (Old) Microsoft Edge browser ios incompatible with Kibana, you must use the chromium based browser for the dashboard to display correctly. You will see a blank page when loading the dashboards using an unsupported browser. See here for supported browsers for Kibana.
