# Download and install Azure Data Studio

Azure Data Studio is a cross-platform database tool for data professionals using on-premises and cloud data platforms on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Azure Data Studio offers a modern editor experience with IntelliSense, code snippets, source control integration, and an integrated terminal. It's engineered with the data platform user in mind, with the built-in charting of query result sets and customizable dashboards.

Use Azure Data Studio to query, design, and manage your databases and data warehouses, wherever they are - on your local computer or in the cloud.

## Install Azure Data Studio

### Windows install

[!INCLUDE [ssms-ads-install](../includes/ssms-azure-data-studio-install.md)]

This release of Azure Data Studio includes a standard Windows Installer experience and a .zip file.

We recommend the *user installer* because it doesn't require administrator privileges, simplifying installs and upgrades. The user installer doesn't require Administrator privileges as the location is under your user Local AppData (LOCALAPPDATA) folder. The user installer also provides a smoother background update experience. For more information, see [User setup for Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_26#_user-setup-for-windows).

**User Installer** (recommended)

1. Download and run the [Azure Data Studio *user* installer for Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2165736).

2. Start the Azure Data Studio app.

**System Installer**

1. Download and run the [Azure Data Studio *system* installer for Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163437).

2. Start the Azure Data Studio app.

**.zip file**

1. Download [Azure Data Studio .zip for Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2165838).

2. Browse to the downloaded file and extract it.

3. Run `\azuredatastudio-windows\azuredatastudio.exe`

#### Unattended install for Windows

You can also install Azure Data Studio using a command prompt script.

If you want to install Azure Data Studio in the background with no GUI prompts, and you're on the Windows platform, then follow the steps below.

1. Launch the command prompt with elevated permissions.

2. Type the command below in the command prompt.

    ```console
    <path where the azuredatastudio-windows-user-setup-x.xx.x.exe file is located> /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode>
    ```

    Example:

    ```console
    %systemdrive%\azuredatastudio-windows-user-setup-1.24.0.exe /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode
    ```

    > [!Note]
    > The example also works with the system installer file.
    > 
    > ```console
    > <path where the azuredatastudio-windows-setup-x.xx.x.exe file is located> /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode>
    > ```

    You can also pass */SILENT* instead of */VERYSILENT* to see the setup UI.

3. If all goes well, you can see Azure Data Studio installed.

## Check for updates

To check for the latest updates, select the gear icon on the bottom left of the window and select **Check for Updates**.

Offline environment updates can be applied by [installing the latest version](#download-and-install-azure-data-studio) directly over a previously installed version. Uninstalling prior versions of Azure Data Studio isn't necessary. Instead, the installer updates a currently installed application if present.

## Move user settings

If you're updating SQL Operations Studio to Azure Data Studio and want to keep your settings, keyboard shortcuts, or code snippets, follow the steps below.

*If you already have Azure Data Studio, or you've never installed or customized SQL Operations Studio, then you can ignore this section.*

1. Open Settings by selecting the gear on the bottom left and selecting **Settings.**

2. Right-click the **User Settings** tab on top, and select **Reveal in Explorer**

3. Copy all files in this folder and save them in an easy-to-find location on your local drive, like your Documents folder.

   ![use the files and copy over to your location](./media/download/copy-settings.png)

4. In your new version of Azure Data Studio, follow steps 1-2, then for step 3, paste the contents you saved into the folder. You can also manually copy over the settings, key bindings, or snippets in their respective locations.

5. If overriding an existing installation, delete the old install directory before installation to avoid errors connecting to your Azure account for the resource explorer.
