# Preview features in Azure Data Studio

Azure Data Studio releases continuously. Before new features and improvements are made broadly available, they're first released as **Preview features**. While all Preview features are stable to use, the amount of time a feature remains in Preview can vary from feature to feature. By enabling Preview features, you will get full access to Azure Data Studio features and the chance to provide early feedback.

## How do I enable Preview features?
### On first launch
The first time you launch Azure Data Studio, you'll be greeted with an **Initial Setup Wizard** that guides you through some simple onboarding tasks. You can configure your Preview settings in the first step of the Wizard.

To enable preview features in the **Initial Setup Wizard**, make sure you have selected **opt in (recommended)**. It should be selected by default. When you are finished with the Initial Setup Wizard, Preview features will be enabled.

### In Settings
You can enable or disable Preview features anytime in your Settings.

1. Select the **Gear** icon in the bottom-left corner and then select **Settings** from the context menu. The Settings tab will open.
