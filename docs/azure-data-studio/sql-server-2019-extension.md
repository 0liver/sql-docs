# SQL Server 2019 extension (preview)

The SQL Server 2019 extension (preview) provides preview support for new features and tools shipping in support of [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](..\includes\sssqlv15-md.md)]. This includes preview support for SQL Server 2019 [Big Data Clusters](../big-data-cluster/big-data-cluster-overview.md), an integrated Notebook, Polybase Create External Table wizard for SQL Server, and [Azure Resource Explorer](azure-resource-explorer.md).


## Install the SQL Server 2019 extension (preview)

Download and install the SQL Server 2019 extension (preview):

  |Platform|Download|Release date|
  |:---|:---|:---|

- [readme.md](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2024576)
- [license.txt](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2024593)

In Azure Data Studio choose **Install Extension from VSIX Package** from the **File** menu and select the downloaded .vsix file. Choose **Yes** when prompted to confirm installation and wait for the notification that installation succeeded.

Select **Reload** to enable the extension (only required the first time you install an extension).


##  SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster support

* Click **Add Connection** in *Object Explorer* and choose **SQL Server big data cluster** as the connection type.
* Enter the host name or IP address of the cluster endpoint plus the username & password used to connect.
* Optionally, include a friendly display name in the **Name** field.
* Click **Connect** and you can then launch common tasks from the Dashboard, browse **HDFS** in Object Explorer, and run in-context tasks from there.
* To submit a Spark job against the cluster, right-click on the server node in *Object Explorer* and choose **Submit Spark Job** to bring up the submission dialog.
* To open a Notebook, see the next section.

For details, see [Big Data Clusters](../big-data-cluster/big-data-cluster-overview.md).


## Azure Data Studio Notebooks

* Open a notebook in one of the following ways:
  * Open a new notebook from the *Command Palette*.
  * Open the HDFS Object Explorer tree for a SQL Server 2019 big data cluster and either:
    * Right click on the server node and choose **New Jupyter Notebook**.
    * Right click on a CSV file, and choose **Analyze in Notebook**.
  * Open an existing .ipynb file from the **File** menu or file explorer *(.ipynb files must be upgraded to version 4 or higher to load properly)*
* Choose a kernel. For local notebook execution, choose Python 3. For remote execution, choose PySpark or Spark | Scala.
* Choose a SQL Server big data cluster endpoint to connect to if executing remotely (this is not necessary for local development with Python 3).
* Add code or markdown cells via the buttons in the notebook header. Remove cells with the trash can icon to the left of each cell.
* Run cells with the play button for code cells, and toggle markdown editing and preview with the eye icon


## Azure Resource Explorer

* To sign in to Azure, click on the person icon in the bottom left of Azure Data Studio and follow the dialogs to sign in to Azure.
* Once signed in, click on the triangular Azure icon in the left bar of Azure Data Studio and expand the tree to show SQL resources associated with your subscriptions.
* Right-click or click the plug icon on any SQL database or SQL Server to open the connection dialog. Enter your password to connect and add the resource to the Azure Data Studio object explorer.

For details, see [Azure Resource Explorer](azure-resource-explorer.md).


## Polybase Create External Table Wizard

* From a SQL Server 2019 instance the *Create External Table Wizard* can be opened in three ways:
  * Right click on a server, choose **Manage**, click on the tab for SQL Server 2019 (Preview), and choose **Create External Table**.
  * With a SQL Server 2019 instance selected in *Object Explorer*, bring up *Create External Wizard* via the *Command Palette*.
  * Right click on a SQL Server 2019 database in *Object Explorer* and choose **Create External Table**.
* In this version of the extension, external tables may be created to access remote SQL Server and Oracle tables.

  > [!NOTE]
  > While the External Table functionality is a SQL 2019 feature, the remote SQL Server may be running an earlier version of SQL Server.

* Choose whether you are accessing SQL Server or Oracle on the first page of the wizard and continue.
* You will be prompted to create a Database Master Key if one has not already been created (passwords of insufficient complexity will be blocked).
* Create a data source connection and named credential for the remote server.
* Choose which objects to map to your new external table.
* Choose **Generate Script** or **Create** to finish the wizard.
* After creation of the external table, it immediately appears in the object tree of the database where it was created.


## Known Issues

* If password is not saved when creating a connection, some actions such as submitting Spark Job may not succeed.
* Existing .ipynb notebooks must be upgraded to version 4 or higher to load contents in the viewer.
