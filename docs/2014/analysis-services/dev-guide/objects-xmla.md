# Objects (XMLA)
  The XML for Analysis (XMLA) protocol uses two methods, `Discover` and `Execute`, to offer a standard way for applications to access information on an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. Because these methods are invoked by using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) protocol, they accept input and deliver output in XML.  
  
## In This Section  
 The following topics describe the XMLA objects implemented by [!INCLUDE[ssAS](../../includes/ssas-md.md)].  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[DiscoverResponse Element &#40;XMLA&#41;](../../../2014/analysis-services/dev-guide/discoverresponse-element-xmla.md)|Contains the information returned by an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] in response to a [Discover](../../../2014/analysis-services/dev-guide/discover-method-xmla.md) method call.|  
|[ExecuteResponse Element &#40;XMLA&#41;](../../../2014/analysis-services/dev-guide/executeresponse-element-xmla.md)|Contains the information returned by an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] in response to an [Execute](../../../2014/analysis-services/dev-guide/execute-method-xmla.md) method call.|
