# Operators (SSIS Expression)
  This section describes the operators the expression language provides and the operator precedence and associativity that the expression evaluator uses.  
  
 The following table lists topics about operators in this section.  
  
|Operator|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|[Cast &#40;SSIS Expression&#41;](../../2014/integration-services/cast-ssis-expression.md)|Converts an expression from one data type to a different data type.|

|[Divide &#40;SSIS Expression&#41;](../../2014/integration-services/divide-ssis-expression.md)|Divides the first numeric expression by the second one.|  
|[&#40;Modulo&#41; &#40;SSIS Expression&#41;](../../2014/integration-services/modulo-ssis-expression.md)|Provides the integer remainder after dividing the first numeric expression by the second one.|  
|[&#124;&#124; &#40;Logical OR&#41; &#40;SSIS Expression&#41;](../../2014/integration-services/logical-or-ssis-expression.md)|Performs a logical OR operation.|

|[& &#40;Bitwise AND&#41; &#40;SSIS Expression&#41;](../../2014/integration-services/bitwise-and-ssis-expression.md)|Performs a bitwise AND operation of two integer values.|  
|[~ &#40;Bitwise Not&#41; &#40;SSIS Expression&#41;](../../2014/integration-services/bitwise-not-ssis-expression.md)|Performs a bitwise negation of an integer.|  
|[== &#40;Equal&#41; &#40;SSIS Expression&#41;](../../2014/integration-services/equal-ssis-expression.md)|Performs a comparison to determine if two expressions are equal.|  
|[!= &#40;Unequal&#41; &#40;SSIS Expression&#41;](../../2014/integration-services/unequal-ssis-expression.md)|Performs a comparison to determine if two expressions are not equal.|

|[&#62;= &#40;Greater Than or Equal To&#41; &#40;SSIS Expression&#41;](../../2014/integration-services/greater-than-or-equal-to-ssis-expression.md)|Performs a comparison to determine if the first expression is greater than or equal to the second one.|  
|[&#60;= &#40;Less Than or Equal To&#41; &#40;SSIS Expression&#41;](../../2014/integration-services/less-than-or-equal-to-ssis-expression.md)|Performs a comparison to determine if the first expression is less than or equal to the second one.|  
|[? : &#40;Conditional&#41; &#40;SSIS Expression&#41;](../../2014/integration-services/conditional-ssis-expression.md)|Returns one of two expressions based on the evaluation of a Boolean expression.|
