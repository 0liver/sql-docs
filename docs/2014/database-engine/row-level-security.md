# Row-Level Security
  Row-Level Security enables customers to control access to rows in a database table based on the characteristics of the user executing a query (e.g., group membership or execution context). Row-Level Security is now available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2016. See [Row-Level Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn765131.aspx) in the current documentation for the current description of this feature.
