Report parts are self-contained report items that are stored on the report server and can be included in other reports. Use Report Builder to browse and select parts from the Report Part Gallery to add to your reports. Use Report Designer or Report Builder to save report parts for use in the Report Part Gallery. However, report parts are deprecated for all releases of SQL Server Reporting Services after SQL Server Reporting Services 2019.
