> [!NOTE]
> There are two SQL Server PowerShell modules; [SqlServer](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sqlserver) and [SQLPS](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sqlps).
>
> The **SqlServer** module is the current PowerShell module to use.
>
> The **SQLPS** module is included with the SQL Server installation (for backward compatibility) but is no longer updated.
>
> The **SqlServer** module contains updated versions of the cmdlets in **SQLPS** and includes new cmdlets to support the latest SQL features.
>
> Previous versions of the **SqlServer** module were included with [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md) 16.x versions of SSMS only.
>
> To use PowerShell with SSMS 17.0 and later, install the **SqlServer** module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer).
