The [SQL Server Native Client](../relational-databases/native-client/sql-server-native-client.md) has been removed from [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](sssql22-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] 19 (SSMS). Both the SQL Server Native Client (SNAC) OLE DB provider (SQLNCLI or SQLNCLI11) and the legacy Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server (SQLOLEDB) are not recommended for new development. Switch to the new [Microsoft OLE DB Driver (MSOLEDBSQL) for SQL Server](../connect/oledb/oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md) or the latest [Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server](../connect/odbc/microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md) going forward.
