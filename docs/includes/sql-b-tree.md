> [!NOTE]
> SQL Server documentation uses the term B-tree generally in reference to indexes. In rowstore indexes, SQL Server implements a B+ tree. This does not apply to columnstore indexes or in-memory data stores. Review [SQL Server Index Architecture and Design Guide](../relational-databases/sql-server-index-design-guide.md) for details.
