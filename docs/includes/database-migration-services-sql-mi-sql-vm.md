You can use the Azure SQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio to migrate SQL Server databases to either Azure SQL Managed Instance (Platform-as-a-Service) or to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (Infrastructure-as-a-Service).<br/><br/>
The Azure SQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio brings together a simplified assessment, Azure recommendation and migration experience that delivers the following capabilities:<br/>
 - A responsive user interface that provides an easy-to-navigate step-by-step wizard to deliver an integrated assessment, Azure recommendation and migration experience.
 - An enhanced assessment engine that can assess SQL Server instances and identify databases that are ready for migration to Azure SQL Managed Instance or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.
 - An Azure recommender to generate right-sized recommendation for Azure SQL Managed Instance SKU or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines SKU to meet your database(s)' performance requirements with minimal cost.
 - A reliable Azure service powered by Azure Database Migration service that orchestrates data movement activities to deliver a seamless migration experience with minimal downtime.
 - The ability to run migrations in either online (for migrations that require minimal downtime) or offline (for migrations where downtime persists through the duration of the migration) modes to suit your business requirements.
 - The flexibility to install self hosted integration runtime to provide your own compute for access to source SQL Server and backups in your on-premises environment.<br/>
