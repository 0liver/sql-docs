We accumulate and retain documentation for very old versions of Microsoft SQL Server in sets of archived webpages. The archived webpages are not processed by search engines, such as Bing.com and Google.com. Yet you can see these archives at our Docs _previous-versions/sql/_ address:

- [https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/sql/](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/sql/)

These archives include the documentation for at least the following older versions:

- SQL Server 2012
- SQL Server 2008 R2
- SQL Server 2008
- SQL Server 2005

[SQL Server 2014 documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/2014-toc/index?view=sql-server-2014) is still processed by search engines.

[SQL Server 2017 documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/sql-server/sql-server-technical-documentation.md?toc=../toc/toc.json&view=sql-server-2017) is available.

For more information about the documentation for previous versions of SQL Server, see [Previous versions of SQL Server documentation](/sql/toc/previous-versions-sql-server?view=sql-server-previousversions).
