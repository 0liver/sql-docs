# Programming Databases with T-SQL for Beginners

This page provides video content for learning about Transact-SQL (T-SQL).

In this video series, you learn the basics of Transact-SQL. You see how to add, edit, delete, and query data in a relational database. You follow along with Marisa Mathews and Buck Woody as they create a database together for a real-world application from start to finish using SQL Server. After completing the video series and the accompanying Microsoft Learn modules, you have the foundational knowledge to work with Transact-SQL in your applications.

## RDBMS and Setup
