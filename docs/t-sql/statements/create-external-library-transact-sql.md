# CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY (Transact-SQL)  
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ssvnxt-xxxx-xxxx-xxx](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssvnxt-xxxx-xxxx-xxx.md)]  

Uploads R packages to a database from the specified byte stream, file path, or blob store url.

This statement serves as a generic mechanism for the database administrator to upload artifacts needed for any new external language runtimes (R, Python, Java, etc.) and OS platforms supported by SQL Server. 

## Syntax

```
CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY library_name  
    [ AUTHORIZATION owner_name ]  
FROM <file_spec> [,…2]  
WITH ( <library_option> [,…n] )  
[ ; ]  

<library_option> :: =  
  LANGUAGE = 'R' 
| 'Python'  
| DATA_SOURCE = external_data_source_name  

<file_spec> ::=  
{  
(CONTENT = { <client_library_specifier> | <library_bits> }  
[, PLATFORM = WINDOWS | LINUX])  
}  

<client_library_specifier> :: =  
  '[\\computer_name\]share_name\[path\]manifest_file_name'  
| '[local_path\]manifest_file_name'  
| '<relative_path_in_external_data_source>'  

<library_bits> :: =  
{ varbinary_literal | varbinary_expression }  
```

### Arguments

**library_name**

Libraries are added to the database scoped to the user. That is, library names are considered unique within the context of a specific user or owner.

For example, two users **RUser1** and **RUser2** can both individually and separately upload the R library ggplot2. the zip file for this R package contains the Windows version binaries, and the .gz file contains the Linux version binaries. Both users could upload the Windows version, and then both users could also add the Linux platform version to their libraries by calling `ALTER EXTERNAL LIBRARY`.

However, neither user could subsequently upload a Python library called "ggplot2". In short, library names must be unique per user. The library name need not be aligned with the source package name, and is purely for SQL management purposes.

**owner_name**

Specifies the name of the user or role that owns the external library. If not specified, ownership is given to the current user.

The libraries owned by database owner are considered global to the database and runtime. In other words, database owners can create libraries that contain a common set of libraries or packages that are shared by many users. 

When the user **RUser1** executes an R script, the value of `libPath` can contain multiple paths. The first path is always the path to the shared library created by the database owner. The second part of `libPath` specifies the path containing packages uploaded individually by **RUser1**.

**file_spec**

Specifies the content of the package for a specific platform. Only one file artifact per platform will be supported. 

The file can be specified in the form of a local path, network path, or path to a blob storage account, or as a binary blob. Use of Azure BLOB store URL will be supported only for SQLDB. If the data source option is specified, the file name can be a relative path with respect to the container referenced in the `EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE`.

Optionally, an OS platform for the file can be specified. Only one file artifact or content is permitted for each OS platform for a specific language or runtime.

**DATA_SOURCE = external_data_source_name**

Specifies the name of the external data source that contains the location of the library file. This location should reference an Azure blob storage path. To create an external data source, use [CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE (Transact-SQL)](create-external-data-source-transact-sql.md).

**PLATFORM = WINDOWS | LINUX**

Specifies the platform for the content of the library. The value will default automatically to the host platform on which SQL Server is running. Therefore, the user doesn’t have to specify the value. It is required in case where multiple platforms are supported, or the user needs to specify a different platform.

### Return values

An informational message is returned if the statement was successful.  
- "Library installation successful"  

If the statement failed, these messages might be returned:  
- "File does not exist in the given path when creating external library"  
- "The DB user does not have permission to the folder containing the package"  
- "The package that is being removed does not exist"  
- "Extensibility not enabled"  

## Remarks

For the R language, packages must be prepared in the form of zipped archive files with the .ZIP extension for Windows, and .tar files with the .gz extension for Linux.

Instructions will be provided at a later date for package installation on Linux, or for Python libraries.

Currently, only the Windows platform is supported.

## Examples

### Add ggplot2 to a database

The database administrator needs to install R packages on a specific database, and make them available to all users of the database. To install the packages, he must log into SQL Server using the database owner role and run the following statement to generate the package library:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY ggplot2 
FROM 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\ggplot2.zip'
```

For this to work, the folder where the packages are saved must be accessible to the server. 

### Change an existing package library

The `ALTER EXTERNAL LIBRARY` DDL statement can be used to add new library content or modify existing library content. 

New content can be added for a library only for a new platform. For example, if there is an existing package for `ggplot2` for the WINDOWS platform, the `ALTER EXTERNAL LIBRARY ADD` statement can be used only to add content for the LINUX platform.

### Delete a package library

To delete a package library from the database, run the statement:

```sql
DROP EXTERNAL LIBRARY ggplot2 <user_name>;
```

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike other `DROP` statements in SQL Server, this statement supports an optional parameter that specifies the user authority. This option allows users with ownership roles to delete libraries uploaded by regular users.
