# ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW (Transact-SQL) (preview)

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-xxxx-asdw-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-xxxx-asdw-xxx-md.md)]

Modifies a previously created materialized view. ALTER VIEW does not affect dependent stored procedures or triggers and does not change permissions.

## Syntax  
  
```
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW [ schema_name . ] view_name
{
      REBUILD | DISABLE
}
[;]
```  
  
## Arguments

 *schema_name*     
 Is the name of the schema to which the view belongs.  
  
 *view_name*     
 Is the materialized view to change.  
  
*REBUILD*   
Resumes the materialized view.

*DISABLE*   
Suspends maintenance on the materialized view while maintaining metadata and permissions.â€¯ All queries against the materialized view while in a disabled state resolve against the underlying tables.
  
## Permissions

ALTER permission on the table or view is required.
  
## Examples

This example disables a materialized view and puts it in suspended mode.
  
```sql
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW My_Indexed_View DISABLE;  
```  
  
This example resumes materialized view by rebuilding it.  
  
```sql
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW My_Indexed_View REBUILD;  
```
