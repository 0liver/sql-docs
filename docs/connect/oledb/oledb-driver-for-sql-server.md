# OLE DB Driver for SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

MSOLEDBSQL, or OLE DB Driver for SQL Server, is a term that has been used interchangeably to refer to OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.

## Different generations of OLE DB Drivers

There are three distinct generations of Microsoft OLE DB providers for SQL Server.

### 1. Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server (SQLOLEDB)
The [Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server](../../ado/guide/appendixes/microsoft-ole-db-provider-for-sql-server.md) (SQLOLEDB) still ships as part of [Windows Data Access Components](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms692897.aspx). It is not recommended to use this driver for new development.


### 2. SQL Server Native Client (SNAC)
Starting in SQL Server 2005, the [SQL Server Native Client (SNAC)](../../relational-databases/native-client/sql-server-native-client.md) includes an OLE DB provider interface (SQLNCLI) and is the OLE DB provider that shipped with SQL Server 2005 through SQL Server 2017.

It was [announced as deprecated in 2011](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlnativeclient/2011/08/29/microsoft-is-aligning-with-odbc-for-native-relational-data-access/) and it is not recommended to use this driver for new development.

### 3. Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server (MSOLEDBSQL)
OLE DB was [announced as undeprecated in 2017](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlnativeclient/2017/10/06/announcing-the-new-release-of-ole-db-driver-for-sql-server/). A new planned release was announced for 2018.

The new OLE DB provider is called the Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server (MSOLEDBSQL). The new provider will be updated with the most recent server features going forward.
