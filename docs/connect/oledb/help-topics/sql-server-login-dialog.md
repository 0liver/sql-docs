# SQL Server Login Dialog Box (OLE DB)
When you attempt to connect without specifying enough information for the driver to connect, the OLE DB driver displays the **SQL Server Login** dialog box.

> [!NOTE]  
> SQL Server Login Dialog can be suppressed by setting `DBPROP_INIT_PROMPT` property of the `DBPROPSET_DBINIT` property set to `NO_PROMPT`. For more information about other possible options please view [this](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/ms714342(v=vs.80)) documentation page.

## Options

### Server
The name of an instance of SQL Server on your network. Select a server\instance name from the list, or type the server\instance name in the **Server** box. Optionally, you can create a server alias on the client computer using **SQL Server Configuration Manager**, and type that name in the **Server** box.

You can enter "(local)" when you are using the same computer as SQL Server. You can then connect to a local instance of SQL Server, even when running a non-networked version of SQL Server.

For more information about server names for different types of networks, see [SQL Server installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/installation-for-sql-server).

### Authentication Mode
You can select the following authentication options from the drop-down list:
- `Windows Authentication:` Authentication to SQL Server using the currently logged-in user's account
- `SQL Server Authentication:` Authentication to SQL Server using login ID and password
- `Active Directory - Integrated:` Integrated authentication using the currently logged-in user's account
- `Active Directory - Password:` Active Directory authentication using login ID and password


### Server SPN
If you use a trusted connection, you can specify a service principal name (SPN) for the server.

### Login ID
Specifies the login ID to use for the connection. The Login ID text box is only enabled if `Authentication Mode` is set to `SQL Server Authentication` or `Active Directory - Password`. Otherwise, the **Login ID** box is disabled.

### Password
Specifies the password used for the connection if `Authentication Mode` is set to `SQL Server Authentication` or `Active Directory - Password`. Otherwise, the **Password** box is disabled.

### Options
Displays or hides the **Options** group. The **Options** button is enabled if **Server** has a value.

### Change Password
Enables **New Password** and **Confirm New Password** text boxes.

### New Password
Specifies the new password.

### Confirm New Password
Specifies the new password a second time, for confirmation.

### Database
Specifies the default database to use on the connection. This setting overrides the default database specified for the login on the server. If no database is specified, the connection uses the default database specified for the login on the server.

### Mirror Server
Specifies the name of the failover partner of the database to be mirrored.

### Mirror SPN
Optionally, you can specify an SPN for the mirror server. The SPN for the mirror server is used for mutual authentication between client and server.

### Language
Specifies the national language to use for SQL Server system messages. The computer running SQL Server must have the language installed. This setting overrides the default language specified for the login on the server. If no language is specified, the connection uses the default language specified for the login on the server.

### Application Name
(Optional) Specifies the application name to be stored in the **program_name** column in the row for this connection in **sys.sysprocesses**.

### Workstation ID
(Optional) Specifies the workstation ID to be stored in the **hostname** column in the row for this connection in **sys.sysprocesses**.

### Use strong encryption for data
When checked, data that is passed through the connection will be encrypted.

### Trust server certificate
When checked, the server's certificate will be validated. Server's certificate must have the correct hostname of the server and issued by a trusted certificate authority.

> [!NOTE]  
> When using `Windows Authentication` or `SQL Server Authentication`, Trust server certificate option is applicable **only** when **Use strong encryption for data** is enabled. However, when using `ActiveDirectoryPassword`, `ActiveDirectoryIntegrated`, `Access Token` or `SqlPassword` authentication options, Trust server certificate option is considered **regardless of encryption settings**. This new behavior was introduced to improve security.
