# Using Always Encrypted with the ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[Driver_ODBC_Download](../../includes/driver_odbc_download.md)]

This article provides information on how to develop ODBC applications using [Always Encrypted (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt163865.aspx) and the [ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server](../../connect/odbc/windows/microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server-on-windows.md).

Always Encrypted allows client applications to encrypt sensitive data and never reveal the data or the encryption keys to SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. An Always Encrypted enabled driver, such as the ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server, achieves this by transparently encrypting and decrypting sensitive data in the client application. The driver automatically determines which query parameters correspond to sensitive database columns (protected using Always Encrypted), and encrypts the values of those parameters before passing the data to SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. Similarly, the driver transparently decrypts data retrieved from encrypted database columns in query results. For more information, see [Always Encrypted (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt163865.aspx).

### Prerequisites

Configure Always Encrypted in your database. This involves provisioning Always Encrypted keys and setting up encryption for selected database columns. If you do not already have a database with Always Encrypted configured, follow the directions in [Getting Started with Always Encrypted](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt163865.aspx#Anchor_5).

### Enabling Always Encrypted for Application Queries

The easiest way to enable the encryption of parameters, and the decryption of query results targeting the encrypted columns, is by setting the value of the `ColumnEncryption` connection string keyword to **`Enabled`**.

The following is an example of a connection string that enables Always Encrypted:
```
SQLWCHAR *connString = L"Driver={ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server};Server={myServer};Trusted_Connection=yes;ColumnEncryption=Enabled;";
```

The following is an equivalent example using the SQLSetConnectAttr function to set the pre-connection attribute programmatically. Setting it this way overrides the value set in the connection string:

```
 SQLSetConnectAttr(hdbc, SQL_COPT_SS_COLUMN_ENCRYPTION, (SQLPOINTER)SQL_COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_ENABLE, 0);
```

Always Encrypted can also be enabled for individual queries. See the **Controlling the Performance Impact of Always Encrypted** section below for more information.

Note that enabling Always Encrypted is not sufficient for encryption or decryption to succeed. You also need to make sure that:

- The application has the *VIEW ANY COLUMN MASTER KEY DEFINITION* and *VIEW ANY COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY DEFINITION* database permissions, required to access the metadata about Always Encrypted keys in the database. For details, see [Permissions section in Always Encrypted (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt163865.aspx#Anchor_7).

- The application can access the column master key that protects the column encryption keys encrypting the queried database columns. This is dependent on the keystore provider which stores the CMK (see below).

#### Retrieving and Modifying Data in Encrypted Columns

Once you enable Always Encrypted for application queries, you can use standard ODBC APIs (see [ODBC sample code](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/ODBC-sample-191624ae/sourcecode?fileId=51137&pathId=1980325953) or [ODBC Programmer's Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms714177(v=vs.85).aspx)), to retrieve or modify data in encrypted database columns. Assuming your application has the required database permissions and can access the column master key, the ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server will encrypt any query parameters that target encrypted columns, and will decrypt data retrieved from encrypted columns, returning plaintext values of ODBC types corresponding to the SQL Server data types set for the columns in the database schema.
If Always Encrypted is not enabled, queries with parameters that target encrypted columns will fail. Queries can still retrieve data from encrypted columns, as long as the query has no parameters targeting encrypted columns. However, the driver will not attempt to decrypt any values retrieved from encrypted columns and the application will receive binary encrypted data (as byte arrays).

The table below summarizes the behavior of queries, depending on whether Always Encrypted is enabled or not:

|Query characteristic | Always Encrypted is enabled and application can access the keys and key metadata|Always Encrypted is enabled and application cannot access the keys or key metadata | Always Encrypted is disabled|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Queries with parameters targeting encrypted columns. | Parameter values are transparently encrypted. | Error | Error|
| Queries retrieving data from encrypted columns, without parameters targeting encrypted columns.| Results from encrypted columns are transparently decrypted. The application receives plaintext values of the ODBC datatypes corresponding to the SQL Server types configured for the encrypted columns. | Error | Results from encrypted columns are not decrypted. The application receives encrypted values as byte arrays.

The following examples illustrate retrieving and modifying data in encrypted columns. The examples assume a table with the following schema. Note that the SSN and BirthDate columns are encrypted.


```
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Patients](
 [PatientId] [int] IDENTITY(1,1),
 [SSN] [char](11) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2
 ENCRYPTED WITH (ENCRYPTION_TYPE = DETERMINISTIC,
 ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256',
 COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = CEK1) NOT NULL,
 [FirstName] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
 [LastName] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
 [BirthDate] [date]
 ENCRYPTED WITH (ENCRYPTION_TYPE = RANDOMIZED,
 ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256',
 COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = CEK1) NOT NULL
 PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([PatientId] ASC) ON [PRIMARY] )
 GO
```

#### Inserting Data Example

This example inserts a row into the Patients table. Note the following:

- There is nothing specific to encryption in the sample code. The ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server automatically detects and encrypts the values of the SSN and date parameters that target encrypted columns. This makes encryption transparent to the application.

- The values inserted into database columns, including the encrypted columns, are passed as bound parameters (See [SQLBindParameter Function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms710963(v=vs.85).aspx)). While using parameters is optional when sending values to non-encrypted columns (although it is highly recommended because it helps prevent SQL injection), it is required for values targeting encrypted columns. If the values inserted in the SSN or BirthDate columns were passed as literals embedded in the query statement, the query would fail because the driver would not be able to determine the values in the target encrypted columns, so it would not encrypt the values. As a result, the server would reject them as incompatible with the encrypted columns.

- The data type of the parameter targeting the SSN column is set to an ANSI (non-Unicode) string, which maps to the char/varchar SQL Server data type (`rc = SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 1, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_CHAR, SQL_CHAR, 11, 0, (SQLPOINTER)SSN, 0, &cbSSN);`). If the type of the parameter was set to a Unicode string, which maps to nchar/nvarchar, the query would fail, as Always Encrypted does not support conversions from encrypted nchar/nvarchar values to encrypted char/varchar values. See [ODBC Programmer's Reference -- Appendix D: Data Types](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms713607.aspx) for information about the data type mappings.

```
    SQL_DATE_STRUCT date;
    SQLLEN cbdate;   // size of date structure  

    SQLCHAR SSN[12];
    strcpy_s((char*)SSN, _countof(SSN), "795-73-9838");

    SQLWCHAR* firstName = L"Catherine";
    SQLWCHAR* lastName = L"Abel";
    SQLINTEGER cbSSN = SQL_NTS, cbFirstName = SQL_NTS, cbLastName = SQL_NTS;

    // Initialize the date structure  
    date.day = 10;
    date.month = 9;
    date.year = 1996;

    // Size of structures   
    cbdate = sizeof(SQL_DATE_STRUCT);

    SQLRETURN rc = 0;

    string queryText = "INSERT INTO [dbo].[Patients] ([SSN], [FirstName], [LastName], [BirthDate]) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?) ";

    rc = SQLPrepare(hstmt, (SQLCHAR *)queryText.c_str(), SQL_NTS);

    //SSN
    rc = SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 1, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_CHAR, SQL_CHAR, 11, 0, (SQLPOINTER)SSN, 0, &cbSSN);
    //FirstName
    rc = SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 2, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_WCHAR, SQL_WCHAR, 50, 0, (SQLPOINTER)firstName, 0, &cbFirstName);
    //LastName
    rc = SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 3, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_WCHAR, SQL_WCHAR, 50, 0, (SQLPOINTER)lastName, 0, &cbLastName);
    //BirthDate
    rc = SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 4, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_TYPE_DATE, SQL_TYPE_DATE, 10, 0, (SQLPOINTER)&date, 0, &cbdate);

    rc = SQLExecute(hstmt);
```

#### Retrieving Plaintext Data Example

The following example demonstrates filtering data based on encrypted values, and retrieving plaintext data from encrypted columns. Note the following:

- The value used in the WHERE clause to filter on the SSN column needs to be passed using SQLBindParameter, so that the driver can transparently encrypt it before sending it to the database.

- All values printed by the program will be in plaintext, as the driver will transparently decrypt the data retrieved from the SSN and BirthDate columns.

> [!NOTE]
> Queries can perform equality comparisons on columns if they are encrypted using deterministic encryption. For more information, see the *Selecting Deterministic or Randomized encryption* section of [Always Encrypted (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt163865.aspx).

```
SQLCHAR SSN[12];
strcpy_s((char*)SSN, _countof(SSN), "795-73-9838");

SQLWCHAR* firstName = L"Catherine";
SQLWCHAR* lastName = L"Abel";
SQLINTEGER cbSSN = SQL_NTS, cbFirstName = SQL_NTS, cbLastName = SQL_NTS;

SQLRETURN rc = 0;
string empty = "";
string queryText = "SELECT [SSN], [FirstName], [LastName], [BirthDate] " + empty +
    "FROM  [dbo].[Patients]" +
    "WHERE " +
    "[SSN] = ? ";

rc = SQLPrepare(hstmt, (SQLCHAR *)queryText.c_str(), SQL_NTS);

//SSN
rc = SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 1, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_CHAR, SQL_CHAR, 11, 0, (SQLPOINTER)SSN, 0, &cbSSN);

rc = SQLExecute(hstmt);
HandleDiagnosticRecord(hstmt, SQL_HANDLE_STMT, rc);

SQL_DATE_STRUCT dateVal;
SQLWCHAR firstNameVal[50];
SQLWCHAR lastNameVal[50];
SQLCHAR SSNVal[12];
SQLLEN cbdate;   // size of date structure  

int rowcount = 0;
while (SQL_SUCCEEDED(SQLFetch(hstmt)))
{
    rowcount++;
    SQLGetData(hstmt, 1, SQL_C_CHAR, &SSNVal, 11, &cbSSN);
    SQLGetData(hstmt, 2, SQL_C_WCHAR, &firstNameVal, 50, &cbFirstName);
    SQLGetData(hstmt, 3, SQL_C_WCHAR, &lastNameVal, 50, &cbLastName);
    SQLGetData(hstmt, 4, SQL_C_TYPE_DATE, &dateVal, 10, &cbdate);        
}
```

#### Retrieving Encrypted Data Example

If Always Encrypted is not enabled, a query can still retrieve data from encrypted columns, as long as the query has no parameters targeting encrypted columns.

The following examples illustrates retrieving binary encrypted data from encrypted columns. Note the following:

- As Always Encrypted is not enabled in the connection string, the query will return encrypted values of SSN and BirthDate as byte arrays (the program converts the values to strings).
- A query retrieving data from encrypted columns with Always Encrypted disabled can have parameters, as long as none of the parameters target an encrypted column. The above query filters by LastName, which is not encrypted in the database. If the query filtered by SSN or BirthDate, the query would fail.


```
SQLCHAR SSN[12];
strcpy_s((char*)SSN, _countof(SSN), "795-73-9838");

SQLWCHAR* firstName = L"Catherine";
SQLWCHAR* lastName = L"Abel";
SQLINTEGER cbSSN = SQL_NTS, cbFirstName = SQL_NTS, cbLastName = SQL_NTS;

SQLRETURN rc = 0;
string empty = "";
string queryText = "SELECT [SSN], [FirstName], [LastName], [BirthDate] " + empty +
    "FROM  [dbo].[Patients]" +
    "WHERE " +
    "[LastName] = ?";

rc = SQLPrepare(hstmt, (SQLCHAR *)queryText.c_str(), SQL_NTS);

//LastName
rc = SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 1, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_WCHAR, SQL_WCHAR, 50, 0, (SQLPOINTER)lastName, 0, &cbLastName);

rc = SQLExecute(hstmt);
HandleDiagnosticRecord(hstmt, SQL_HANDLE_STMT, rc);

SQL_DATE_STRUCT dateVal;
SQLWCHAR firstNameVal[50];
SQLWCHAR lastNameVal[50];
SQLCHAR SSNVal[12];
SQLLEN cbdate;   // size of date structure  

int rowcount = 0;
while (SQL_SUCCEEDED(SQLFetch(hstmt)))
{
    rowcount++;
    SQLGetData(hstmt, 1, SQL_C_CHAR, &SSNVal, 11, &cbSSN);
    SQLGetData(hstmt, 2, SQL_C_WCHAR, &firstNameVal, 50, &cbFirstName);
    SQLGetData(hstmt, 3, SQL_C_WCHAR, &lastNameVal, 50, &cbLastName);
    SQLGetData(hstmt, 4, SQL_C_TYPE_DATE, &dateVal, 10, &cbdate);        
}
```

#### Avoiding Common Problems when Querying Encrypted Columns

This section describes common categories of errors when querying encrypted columns from ODBC applications and a few guidelines on how to avoid them.

##### Unsupported data type conversion errors

Always Encrypted supports few conversions for encrypted data types. See [Always Encrypted (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt163865.aspx) for the detailed list of supported type conversions. To avoid data type conversion errors, make sure that:

- You set the types of parameters targeting encrypted columns, so that the SQL Server data type of the parameter is either exactly the same as the type of the target column, or a conversion of the SQL Server data type of the parameter to the target type of the column is supported.

- The precision and scale of parameters targeting columns of the `decimal` and `numeric` SQL Server data types is the same as the precision and scale configured for the target column.

- The precision of parameters targeting columns of `datetime2`, `datetimeoffset`, or `time` SQL Server data types is not greater than the precision for the target column, in queries that modify values of the target column.  

##### Errors due to passing plaintext instead of encrypted values

Any value that targets an encrypted column needs to be encrypted inside the application. An attempt to insert/modify or to filter by a plaintext value on an encrypted column will result in an error. To prevent such errors, make sure that:

- Always Encrypted is enabled for application queries targeting encrypted columns (in the connection string, by setting the `SQL_COPT_SS_COLUMN_ENCRYPTION` connection attribute for a specific connection, or the `SQL_SOPT_SS_COLUMN_ENCRYPTION` statement attribute for a specific statement).

- You use SQLBindParameter to send data targeting encrypted columns. The example below shows a query that incorrectly filters by a literal/constant on an encrypted column (SSN), instead of passing the literal as an argument to SQLBindParameter.

```
string queryText = "SELECT [SSN], [FirstName], [LastName], [BirthDate] FROM [dbo].[Patients] WHERE SSN='795-73-9838'";
```

### Precautions when using SQLSetPos and SQLMoreResults

#### SQLSetPos

The `SQLSetPos` API allows an application to update rows in a resultset using buffers that were bound with SQLBindCol and into which row data was previously fetched. Due to the asymmetric padding behavior of encrypted fixed-length types, it is possible to unexpectedly alter the data of these columns while performing updates on other columns in the row. With AE, fixed length character values will be padded if the value is smaller than the buffer size. To read more about padding for fixed length types with AE, see [Always Encrypted (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt163865.aspx) and [SQLSetPos Function reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms713507(v=vs.85).aspx).

To mitigate this behavior, use the `SQL_COLUMN_IGNORE` flag to ignore columns that will not be updated as part of `SQLBulkOperations` and when using `SQLSetPos` for cursor based updates.  All columns that are not being directly modified by the application should be ignored, both for performance and to avoid truncation of columns that are bound to a buffer *smaller* than their actual (DB) size.

#### SQLMoreResults & SQLDescribeCol
Application programs may call [SQLDescribeCol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms716289(v=vs.85).aspx) to return metadata about columns in prepared statements.  When Always Encrypted is enabled, calling `SQLMoreResults` *before* calling `SQLDescribeCol` causes `sp_describe_first_result_set` to be called, which does not correctly return the plaintext metadata for encrypted columns. To avoid this issue, call `SQLDescribeCol` on prepared statements *before* calling `SQLMoreResults`.

## Controlling the Performance Impact of Always Encrypted

Because Always Encrypted is a client-side encryption technology, most of the performance overhead is observed on the client side, not in the database. Apart from the cost of encryption and decryption operations, the other sources of performance overhead on the client side are:

- Additional round trips to the database to retrieve metadata for query parameters.

- Calls to a column master key store to access a column master key.

This section describes the built-in performance optimizations in the ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server and how you can control the impact of the above two factors on performance.

### Controlling Round-trips to Retrieve Metadata for Query Parameters

If Always Encrypted is enabled for a connection, the ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server will, by default, call [sys.sp_describe_parameter_encryption](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt631693.aspx) for each parameterized query, passing the query statement (without any parameter values) to SQL Server. `sys.sp_describe_parameter_encryption` analyzes the query statement to find out if any parameters need to be encrypted, and if so, returns the encryption-related information for each parameter to allow the driver to encrypt them. The above behavior ensures a high-level of transparency to the client application: The application (and the application developer) does not need to be aware of which queries access encrypted columns, as long as the values targeting encrypted columns are passed to the driver in parameters.

### Per-Statement Always Encrypted Behaviour

To control the performance impact of retrieving encryption metadata for parameterized queries, you can alter the Always Encrypted behavior for individual queries after setting it up for the connection. This way, you can ensure that `sys.sp_describe_parameter_encryption` is invoked only for queries that you know have parameters targeting encrypted columns. Note, however, that by doing so, you reduce transparency of encryption: if you change the encryption properties of your database columns, you may need to change the code of your application to align it with the schema changes.

To control the Always Encrypted behavior of a statement, call SQLSetStmtAttr to set the `SQL_SOPT_SS_COLUMN_ENCRYPTION` statement attribute to one of the following values:

|Value|Description|
|-|-|
|`SQL_CE_DISABLED` (0)|Always Encrypted is disabled for the statement|
|`SQL_CE_RESULTSETONLY` (1)|Decryption Only. Resultsets and return values are decrypted, and parameters are not encrypted|
|`SQL_CE_ENABLED` (3) | Always Encrypted is enabled and used for both parameters and results|

If most of the queries of a client application access encrypted columns, the following is recommended:

    - Set the `ColumnEncryption` connection string keyword to `Enabled`.

    - Set the `SQL_SOPT_SS_COLUMN_ENCRYPTION` attribute to `SQL_CE_DISABLED` on statements which do not access any encrypted columns. This will disable both calling `sys.sp_describe_parameter_encryption` as well as attempts to decrypt any values in the result set.
    
    - Set the `SQL_SOPT_SS_COLUMN_ENCRYPTION` attribute to `SQL_CE_RESULTSETONLY` on statements which do not have any parameters requiring encryption, but retrieve data from encrypted columns. This will disable calling `sys.sp_describe_parameter_encryption` and parameter encryption. Queries will still be able to decrypt the results from encrypted columns.

## Always Encrypted Security Settings

### Force Column Encryption

To enforce the encryption of a parameter, set the `SQL_CA_SS_FORCE_ENCRYPT` implementation parameter descriptor (IPD) field through a call to the SQLSetDescField function. A non-zero value causes the driver to return an error when no encryption metadata is returned for the associated parameter.

```
SQLHDESC ipd;
SQLGetStmtAttr(hStmt, SQL_ATTR_IMP_PARAM_DESC, &ipd, 0, 0);
SQLSetDescField(ipd, paramNum, SQL_CA_SS_FORCE_ENCRYPT, (SQLPOINTER)TRUE, SQL_IS_SMALLINT);   
```

If SQL Server informs the driver that the parameter does not need to be encrypted, queries using that parameter will fail. This provides additional protection against security attacks which involve a compromised SQL Server providing incorrect encryption metadata to the client, which may lead to data disclosure.

### Column Encryption Key Caching

To reduce the number of calls to a column master key store to decrypt column encryption keys, the driver caches the plaintext column encryption keys in memory. After receiving the encrypted column encryption key value from database metadata, the driver first tries to find the plaintext column encryption key corresponding to the encrypted key value in the cache. The driver calls the key store containing the column master key only if it cannot find the encrypted column encryption key value in the cache.

**Note:** In the ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server, the column encryption key entries in the cache are evicted after a two hour timeout. This means that for a given encrypted column encryption key, the driver contacts the key store only once during the lifetime of the application or every two hours, whichever is less.

## Working with Column Master Key Stores

To encrypt a parameter value or to decrypt data in query results, the driver needs to obtain a column encryption key that is configured for the target column. Column encryption keys are stored in encrypted form in the database metadata. Each column encryption key has a corresponding column master key that was used to encrypt it. The database metadata does not store the column master keys; it only contains the information about a keystore containing a particular column master key, and the location of the key in the keystore.

To obtain the plaintext value of a column encryption key, the driver first obtains the metadata about both the column encryption key and its corresponding column master key, and then it uses the information in the metadata to contact the keystore containing the column master key and request it to decrypt the encrypted column encryption key. The driver communicates with a keystore using a keystore provider.

### Built-in Keystore Providers

The ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server comes with the following built-in column master keystore providers:

| Name | Description | Provider (metadata) name |Availability|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Azure Key Vault |Stores CMKs in an Azure Key Vault | `AZURE_KEY_VAULT` |Windows, macOS, Linux|
|MSSQL Certificate Store|Stores CMKs locally in the Windows keystore| `MSSQL_CERTIFICATE_STORE`|Windows|

- You (or your DBA) need to make sure that the provider name, configured in the column master key metadata, is correct and the column master key path complies with the key path format that is valid for the given provider. It is recommended that you configure the keys using tools such as SQL Server Management Studio, which automatically generates the valid provider names and key paths when issuing the [CREATE COLUMN MASTER KEY (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt146393.aspx) statement.

- You need to ensure your application can access the key in the keystore. This may involve granting your application access to the key and/or the keystore, depending on the keystore, or performing other keystore-specific configuration steps. For example, to access an Azure Key Vault, you need to provide the correct credentials to the keystore.

### Using the Azure Key Vault Provider

Azure Key Vault is a convenient option to store and manage column master keys for Always Encrypted (especially if your applications are hosted in Azure). The ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server on Linux, macOS, and Windows includes a built-in column master key store provider for Azure Key Vault. See [Azure Key Vault – Step by Step](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/kv/2015/06/02/azure-key-vault-step-by-step/), [Getting Started with Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/key-vault-get-started/), and [Creating Column Master Keys in Azure Key Vault](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt723359.aspx#Anchor_2) for more information on configuring an Azure Key Vault for Always Encrypted.

The ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server also supports new connection string keywords which can be used to authenticate to Azure Key Vault with the following credentials:

- Username/Password – with this method, the credentials are the name of an Azure Active Directory user and a user password.

- Client ID/Secret – with this method, the credentials are an application client ID and an application secret.

The table below shows the keywords and their values for the above 2 credential types:

|Credential Type| `KeyStoreAuthentication` |`KeyStorePrincipalId`| `KeyStoreSecret` |
|-|-|-|-|
|Username/password| `KeyVaultPassword`| Azure Active Directory User Principal Name| Azure Active Directory  password|
|Client ID/secret| `KeyVaultClientSecret`| Azure Active Directory Application Client ID| Application Secret|

#### Example Connection Strings

1. Authenticate Azure Key Vault CMK store with ClientID/Secret
```
L"DRIVER=ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server;SERVER=myServer;Trusted_Connection=Yes;DATABASE=myDB;ColumnEncryption=Enabled;KeyStoreAuthentication=KeyVaultClientSecret;KeyStorePrincipalId=<clientId>;KeyStoreSecret=<secret>";
```
2. Authenticate Azure Key Vault CMK store with Username/Password
```
L"DRIVER=ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server;SERVER=myServer;Trusted_Connection=Yes;DATABASE=myDB;ColumnEncryption=Enabled;KeyStoreAuthentication=KeyVaultPassword;KeyStorePrincipalId=<username>;KeyStoreSecret=<password>";
```

### Using the Windows Certificate Store Provider

The ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server on Windows includes a built-in column master key store provider for the Windows Certificate Store, named `MSSQL_CERTIFICATE_STORE`. (This provider is not available on macOS or Linux.) With this provider, the column master key is stored locally on the client machine and no additional configuration by the application is necessary to use it with the driver. However, the application must have access to the certificate and its private key in the store. See [Create and Store Column Master Keys (Always Encrypted)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/create-and-store-column-master-keys-always-encrypted) for more information.

### Using Custom Column Master Key stores with ODBC

The ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server also supports custom third-party keystore providers using the CEKeystoreProvider interface. This allows an application to load, query, and configure keystore providers so that they can be used by the driver to access encrypted columns. Applications may also directly interact with a keystore provider in order to encrypt CEKs for storage in SQL Server and perform tasks beyond accessing encrypted columns with ODBC; for more information, see [Custom Keystore Providers](../../connect/odbc/custom-keystore-providers.md).

From the ODBC client perspective, CEKeystoreProvider interactions occur using Set and Get operations on two connection attributes. The two connection attributes are:

- `SQL_COPT_SS_CEKEYSTOREPROVIDER`

- `SQL_COPT_SS_CEKEYSTOREDATA`

The former is used to load and query loaded keystore providers, while the latter enables application-provider communications. These connection attributes may be used at any time, before or after establishing a connection, since application-provider interaction does not involve communication with SQL Server. However, because the driver has not been loaded yet, setting and getting these attributes before connecting will cause them to be processed by the Driver Manager and may not yield the expected results.

### Loading a Column Encryption Keystore Provider for use with the ODBC driver

Setting the `SQL_COPT_SS_CEKEYSTOREPROVIDER` connection attribute enables a client application to load a CEKeyStoreProvider library, making available for use the CEKeyStoreProviders contained therein.

```
SQLRETURN SQLSetConnectAttr( SQLHDBC ConnectionHandle, SQLINTEGER Attribute, SQLPOINTER ValuePtr, SQLINTEGER StringLength);
```
| Argument | Description |
|:---|:---|
|`ConnectionHandle`|[Input] Connection handle. Must be a valid connection handle, but CEKeyStoreProviders loaded via one connection handle are accessible from any other as CEKeyStoreProviders are loaded per-driver.|
|`Attribute`|[Input] Attribute to set: the `SQL_COPT_SS_CEKEYSTOREPROVIDER` constant.|
|`ValuePtr`|[Input] Pointer to a null-terminated character string specifying the filename of the CEKeyStoreProvider library. For SQLSetConnectAttrA, this is an ANSI (multibyte) string. For SQLSetConnectAttrW, this is a Unicode (wchar_t) string.|
|`StringLength`|[Input] The length of the ValuePtr string, or SQL_NTS.|

The driver attempts to load the CEKeyStoreProvider library identified by the ValuePtr parameter using the platform-defined dynamic library loading mechanism (`dlopen()` on Linux and macOS, `LoadLibrary()` on Windows), and adds any CEKeyStoreProviders defined therein to the list of CEKeyStoreProviders known to the driver. The following errors may occur:

| Error | Description |
|:--|:--|
|`CE203`|The dynamic library could not be loaded.|
|`CE203`|The "CEKeyStoreProvider" exported symbol was not found in the library.|
|`CE203`|One or more CEKeyStoreProviders in the library are already loaded.|

`SQLSetConnectAttr` returns the usual error or success values, and additional information is available for any errors which occurred via the standard ODBC diagnostic mechanism.

NOTE: The application programmer must ensure that any custom CEKeyStoreProviders are loaded before any query requiring them is sent over any connection. Failure to do so results in the error:

| Error | Description |
|:--|:--|
|`CE200`|Keystore provider %1 not found. Ensure that the appropriate keystore provider library has been loaded.|

NOTE: CEKeyStoreProvider implementors should avoid the use of `MSSQL` in the name of their custom providers. This term is reserved exclusively for Microsoft use and may cause conflicts with future built-in CEKeyStoreProviders. Using this term in the name of a custom CEKeyStoreProvider will result in an ODBC warning.

**Getting the `SQL_COPT_SS_CEKEYSTOREPROVIDER` attribute**

Getting this connection attribute enables a client application to determine the CEKeyStoreProviders currently loaded in the driver.
```
SQLRETURN SQLGetConnectAttr( SQLHDBC ConnectionHandle, SQLINTEGER Attribute, SQLPOINTER ValuePtr, SQLINTEGER BufferLength, SQLINTEGER * StringLengthPtr);
```
| Argument | Description |
|:---|:---|
|`ConnectionHandle`|[Input] Connection handle. Must be a valid connection handle, but CEKeyStoreProviders loaded via one connection handle are accessible from any other as CEKeyStoreProviders are loaded per-driver.|
|`Attribute`|[Input] Attribute to retrieve: the `SQL_COPT_SS_CEKEYSTOREPROVIDER` constant.|
|`ValuePtr`|[Output] A pointer to memory in which to return the next loaded CEKeyStoreProvider name.|
|`BufferLength`|[Input] The length of the buffer ValuePtr.|
|`StringLengthPtr`|[Output] A pointer to a buffer in which to return the total number of bytes (excluding the null-termination character) available to return in \*ValuePtr. If ValuePtr is a null pointer, no length is returned. If the attribute value is a character string and the number of bytes available to return is greater than BufferLength minus the length of the null-termination character, the data in \*ValuePtr is truncated to BufferLength minus the length of the null-termination character and is null-terminated by the driver.|

To enable enumeration of multiple CEKeyStoreProviders, every Get operation returns the current CEKeyStoreProvider's name, and increments an internal counter to the next one. Once this counter reaches the end of the list, an empty string "" is returned, and the next Get operation will then retrieve the first CEKeyStoreProvider in the list, the one after that the next, etc.

### Interacting with CEKeyStoreProvider implementations using ODBC

The `SQL_COPT_SS_CEKEYSTOREDATA` connection attribute enables a client application to communicate with loaded CEKeystoreProviders, for establishing additional parameters, keying material, etc. The communication between a client application and a CEKeystoreProvider follows a simple request-response protocol, based on Get and Set requests using this connection attribute. Communication is initiated only by the client application.

NOTE: Due to the nature of the ODBC calls CEKeyStoreProvider’s respond to (SQLGet/SetConnectAttr), the ODBC interface only supports setting data at the resolution of the connection context. **See CONTEXTS section for more information**

CEKeystoreProvider data is communicated between the driver and application, in packet form, via the CEKeystoreData structure:

```
typedef struct CEKeystoreData {
wchar_t *name;
unsigned int dataSize;
char data[];
} CEKEYSTOREDATA;
```
| Argument | Description |
|:---|:---|
|`name`|[Input] Upon Set, the name of the CEKeystoreProvider to which the data is sent. Ignored upon Get. Null-terminated, wide-character string.|
|`dataSize`|[Input] The size of the data array following the structure.|
|`data`|[InOut] Upon Set, the data to be sent to the CEKeystoreProvider. This may be arbitrary data as the driver makes no attempt to interpret it. Upon Get, the buffer to receive the data read from the CEKeystoreProvider.|

**Setting data in a CEKeystoreProvider via ODBC**

A `SQLSetConnectAttr` call using the `SQL_COPT_SS_CEKEYSTOREDATA` attribute writes a "packet" of data to the specified CEKeystoreProvider.
```
SQLRETURN SQLSetConnectAttr( SQLHDBC ConnectionHandle, SQLINTEGER Attribute, SQLPOINTER ValuePtr, SQLINTEGER StringLength);
```
| Argument | Description |
|:---|:---|
|`ConnectionHandle`| [Input] Connection handle. Must be a valid connection handle, but CEKeystoreProviders loaded via one connection handle are accessible from any other as CEKeyStoreProviders are loaded per-driver.|
|`Attribute`|[Input] Attribute to set: the `SQL_COPT_SS_CEKEYSTOREDATA` constant.|
|`ValuePtr`|[Input] Pointer to a CEKeystoreData structure. The name field of the structure identifies the CEKeystoreProvider to which the data is intended.|
|`StringLength`|[Input] SQL_IS_POINTER constant|

Additional detailed error information may be obtained via SQLGetDiacRec. [See SQLGetDiagRec for more information](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms710921(v=vs.85).aspx)

NOTE: It is up to the provider to decide how to treat the CEKeystoreData. Two possible choices are:

1. CEKeystoreData is connection specific.
2. CEKeystoreData is global.

Because the caller of `SQLSetConnectAttr` provides a valid connection handle, the provider can use that information and associate the CEKeystoreData with the connection context. On the other hand, the provider can ignore it and make CEKeystoreData shared. See the Context Management section of [Custom Keystore Providers](../../connect/odbc/custom-keystore-providers.md) for more information.

**Getting data in a CEKeystoreProvider via ODBC**

Reading data from a CEKeystoreProvider via ODBC's `SQLGetConnectAttr` function using the `SQL_COPT_SS_CEKEYSTOREDATA` attribute reads a "packet" of data from the last-written-to CEKeystoreProvider. If no CEKeystoreProvider was written to, a Function Sequence Error occurs. Keystore provider implementers are encouraged to support "dummy writes" of 0 bytes as a way of selecting the provider for read operations without causing other side-effects.

```
SQLRETURN SQLGetConnectAttr( SQLHDBC ConnectionHandle, SQLINTEGER Attribute, SQLPOINTER ValuePtr, SQLINTEGER BufferLength, SQLINTEGER * StringLengthPtr);
```
| Argument | Description |
|:---|:---|
|`ConnectionHandle`|[Input] Connection handle. Must be a valid connection handle, but CEKeystoreProviders loaded via one connection handle are accessible from any other as they are loaded per-driver.|
|`Attribute`|[Input] Attribute to retrieve: the `SQL_COPT_SS_CEKEYSTOREDATA` constant.|
|`ValuePtr`|[Output] A pointer to a CEKeystoreData structure in which the data read from the CEKeystoreProvider is placed.|
|`BufferLength`|[Input] SQL_IS_POINTER constant|
|`StringLengthPtr`|[Output] A pointer to a buffer in which to return BufferLength. If *ValuePtr is a null pointer, no length is returned.|

The caller must ensure that a buffer of sufficient length following the CEKEYSTOREDATA structure is allocated for the provider to write into. Upon return, its dataSize field is updated with the actual length of data read from the provider. Additional detailed error information may be obtained via SQLGetDiacRec. See [SQLGetDiagRec](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms710921(v=vs.85).aspx) for more information.

The interface places no additional requirements on the format of data transferred between an application and a CEKeystoreProvider. Each provider is expected to define its own protocol per its needs.

For an example of implementing your own keystore provider, see [Custom Keystore Providers](../../connect/odbc/custom-keystore-providers.md)

## Limitations of ODBC when using Always Encrypted

### Bulk Copy Function Usage
Use of the [SQL Bulk Copy functions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms130792.aspx) is not supported when using the ODBC driver with Always Encrypted. No transparent encryption/decryption will occur on encrypted columns that are used with the SQL Bulk Copy functions.

### Asynchronous Operations
While the ODBC driver will allow the use of [asynchronous operations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms131658.aspx) with Always Encrypted, there is a performance impact on the operations when Always Encrypted is enabled. The call to `sys.sp_describe_parameter_encryption` to determine encryption metadata for the statement is blocking and will cause the driver to wait for the server to return the metadata before returning `SQL_STILL_EXECUTING`.
