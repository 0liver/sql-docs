# Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS)

![Download-DownArrow-Circled](../../ssdt/media/download.png)[Download ADO.NET](../sql-connection-libraries.md#anchor-20-drivers-relational-access)

Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS) is a feature that allows the execution of multiple batches on a single connection. In previous versions, only one batch could be executed at a time against a single connection. Executing multiple batches with MARS does not imply simultaneous execution of operations.
