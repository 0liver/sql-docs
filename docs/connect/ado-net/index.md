# SQL Server and ADO.NET
This section describes features and behaviors that are specific to the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server (<xref:System.Data.SqlClient>).  
  
 <xref:System.Data.SqlClient> provides access to versions of SQL Server, which encapsulates database-specific protocols. The functionality of the data provider is designed to be similar to that of the .NET Framework data providers for OLE DB, ODBC, and Oracle. <xref:System.Data.SqlClient> includes a tabular data stream (TDS) parser to communicate directly with SQL Server.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To use the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server, an application must reference the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient> namespace.
