# SQL Server Data Tools usage and diagnostic data collection

SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is a component enabled through the Data workload in Visual Studio.  The Visual Studio Customer Experience Improvement Program (VSCEIP) is designed to help Microsoft improve Visual Studio over time. This program collects information about errors, computer hardware, and how people use Visual Studio, without interrupting users in their tasks at the computer.

For more information about the VSCEIP, including how to opt in or opt out, please see the [VSCEIP Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-experience-improvement-program).

For more information about the diagnostic system-generated logs collected, please see the documentation on [system-generated logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/diagnostic-data-collection).


We do not collect your name, address, or any other data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. For more information about the information collected, processed, or transmitted by the VSCEIP, see the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).
