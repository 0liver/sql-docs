# Python tutorial: Predict ski rental with linear regression in SQL Server Machine Learning Services
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

In this four-part tutorial series, you will use Python and linear regression in SQL Server Machine Learning Services to predicts the the number of ski rentals. You will use your own Python integrated development environment (IDE), such as a Jupyter notebook in Azure Data Studio.

Imagine you own a ski rental business and you want to predict the number of rentals that you'll have on a future date. This information will help you get your stock, staff, and facilities ready.

In the first part of this series, you'll get set up with the pre-requsites. In parts two and three, you'll develop some Python scripts in a Jupyter notebook to prepare your data and train a machine learning model. Then, in part three, you'll run those Python scripts inside SQL Server using T-SQL stored procedures.
