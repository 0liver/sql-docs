# Use a Python model in SQL Server for training and scoring
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

This exercise demonstrates the capabilities of Python integration with SQL Server when you [add the machine learning feature](../install/sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install.md) to a database engine instance. On an integrated instance, you can wrap Python code inside a [stored procedure](../../relational-databases/stored-procedures/stored-procedures-database-engine.md), one of the major mechanisms for operationalizing production code in SQL Server. The ability to embed code in a procedure has tangible benefits in how you design, test, and manage data science and machine learning workloads in SQL Server.

In this Python exercise, you will create and execute two procedures. The first one generates a Na√Øve Bayes model to predict an Iris species based on flower characteristics. The second procedure is for scoring. It calls the model generated in the first procedure to output a set of predictions. Because code resides in a stored procedure, operations are contained, reusable, and callable by other stored procedures and client applications. 

## Prerequisites

Sample data used in this exercise is the [**irissql**](demo-data-iris-in-sql.md) database.

You also need a T-SQL editor, such as [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017).

## Create a stored procedure that generates models

A common pattern in SQL Server development is to organize programmable operations into separate stored procedures. In this step, you will create a stored procedure that generates a model for predicting outcomes. Any inputs needed by your Python code are passed as input parameters on the stored procedure.

1. Open a new query window in Management Studio, connected to the **irissql** database. 

    ```sql
    USE irissql
    GO
    ```

2. Copy in the following code to create a new stored procedure. 

   When executed, this procedure calls [sp_execute_external_script](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql) to start a Python session. The output will be a trained model, using the Python **scikit-learn** library for the machine learning algorithm. 

   This code uses [**pickle**](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html) to serialize the model. The model will be trained using data from columns 0 through 4 from the **iris_data** table. The parameters you see in the second part of the procedure articulate data inputs and model outputs. 

    ```sql
    CREATE PROCEDURE generate_iris_model (@trained_model varbinary(max) OUTPUT)
    AS
    BEGIN
    EXEC sp_execute_external_script @language = N'Python',
    @script = N'
    import pickle
    from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
    GNB = GaussianNB()
    trained_model = pickle.dumps(GNB.fit(iris_data[[0,1,2,3]], iris_data[[4]]))
    '
    , @input_data_1 = N'select "Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width", "SpeciesId" from iris_data'
    , @input_data_1_name = N'iris_data'
    , @params = N'@trained_model varbinary(max) OUTPUT'
    , @trained_model = @trained_model OUTPUT;
    END;
    GO
    ```

3. Verify the stored procedure exists. 

   If the T-SQL script from the previous step ran without error, a new stored procedure called **generate_iris_model** is created and added to the **irissql** database. You can find stored procedures in Management Studio's **Object Explorer**, under **Programmability**.

## Execute the procedure to create and train models

In this step, execute the procedure to run the embedded code, creating a trained and serialized model as an output. Models that are stored for reuse in SQL Server are serialized as a byte stream and stored in a VARBINARY(MAX) column in a database table. Once the model is created, trained, serialized, and saved to a database, it can be called by other procedures or by the [PREDICT T-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/predict-transact-sql) function in scoring workloads.

1. Copy the following code to execute the procedure. The specific statement for executing a stored procedure is `EXEC` on the fifth line.

   This particular script deletes an existing model of the same name ("Naive Bayes") to make room for new ones created by rerunning the same procedure. Without model deletion, an error occurs stating the object already exists. The model is stored in a table called **iris_models**, provisioned when you created the **irissql** database.

    ```sql
    DECLARE @model varbinary(max);
    DECLARE @new_model_name varchar(50)
    SET @new_model_name = 'Naive Bayes '
    SELECT @new_model_name 
    EXEC generate_iris_model @model OUTPUT;
    DELETE iris_models WHERE model_name = @new_model_name;
    INSERT INTO iris_models (model_name, model) values(@new_model_name, @model);
    GO
    ```

2. View the results in the output area. The script includes a SELECT statement showing that the model exists. Another way to return a list of models is `SELECT * FROM iris_models` in **irissql**.

    **Results**

    |   | (no column name |
    |---|-----------------|
    | 1 | Naive Bayes     | 


## Create and execute a stored procedure for generating predictions

Now that you have created, trained, and saved a model, move on to the next step: creating a stored procedure that generates predictions. You'll do this by calling sp_execute_external_script to start Python, and then pass in Python script that loads a serialized model you created in the last exercise, and then gives it data inputs to score.

1. Run the following code to create the stored procedure that performs scoring. At run time, this procedure will load a binary model, use columns `[1,2,3,4]` as inputs, and specify columns `[0,5,6]` as output.

    ```sql
    CREATE PROCEDURE predict_species (@model varchar(100))
    AS
    BEGIN
    DECLARE @nb_model varbinary(max) = (SELECT model FROM iris_models WHERE model_name = @model);
    EXEC sp_execute_external_script @language = N'Python', 
    @script = N'
    import pickle
    irismodel = pickle.loads(nb_model)
    species_pred = irismodel.predict(iris_data[[1,2,3,4]])
    iris_data["PredictedSpecies"] = species_pred
    OutputDataSet = iris_data[[0,5,6]] 
    print(OutputDataSet)
    '
    , @input_data_1 = N'select id, "Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width", "SpeciesId" from iris_data'
    , @input_data_1_name = N'iris_data'
    , @params = N'@nb_model varbinary(max)'
    , @nb_model = @nb_model
    WITH RESULT SETS ( ("id" int, "SpeciesId" int, "SpeciesId.Predicted" int));
    END;
    GO
    ```

2. Execute the stored procedure, giving the model name "Naive Bayes" so that the procedure knows which model to use. 

    ```sql
    EXEC predict_species 'Naive Bayes';
    GO
    ```

    When you run the stored procedure, it returns a Python data.frame. This line of T-SQL specifies the schema for the returned results: `WITH RESULT SETS ( ("id" int, "SpeciesId" int, "SpeciesId.Predicted" int));`. You can insert the results into a new table, or return them to an application.

    The results are 150 predictions about species using floral characteristics as inputs. For the majority of the observations, the predicted species matches the actual species.

    This example has been made simple by using the Python iris dataset for both training and scoring. A more typical approach would involve running a SQL query to get the new data, and pass that into Python as `InputDataSet`. 

## Conclusion

In this exercise, you learned how to create stored procedures for different tasks, where each stored procedure used the system stored procedure [sp_execute_external_script](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md) to start a Python process. Inputs to the Python process are passed to sp_execute_external script as parameters. Both the Python script itself and data variables in a SQL Server database are passed as inputs.

If you are used to working in Python, you might be accustomed to loading data, creating some summaries and graphs, then training a model and generating some scores all in the same 250 lines of code. This article differs from customary approaches by organizing operations into separate procedures. This practice is helpful on several levels.

One benefit is that you can separate processes into repeatable steps that can be modified using parameters. As much as possible, you want the Python code that you run in a stored procedure to have clearly defined inputs and outputs that map to stored procedure inputs and outputs that can be passed in at run time. In this exercise, Python code that creates a model (named "Naive Bayes" in this example) is passed as an input to a second stored procedure that calls the model in a scoring process.

A second benefit is that training and scoring processes can be optimized by leveraging features of SQL Server, such as parallel processing, resource governance, or by using algorithms in [revoscalepy](../python/what-is-revoscalepy.md) or [MicrosoftML](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/python-reference/microsoftml/microsoftml-package) that support streaming and parallel execution. By separating training and scoring, you can target optimizations for specific workloads.

## Next steps

Previous tutorials focused on local execution. However, you can also run Python code from a client workstation, using SQL Server as the remote compute context. For more information about setting up a client workstation that connects to SQL Server, see [Set up Python client tools](../python/setup-python-client-tools-sql.md).
