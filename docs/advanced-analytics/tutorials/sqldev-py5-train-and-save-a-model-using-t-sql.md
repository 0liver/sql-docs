# Step 5: Train and Save a Model using T-SQL

In this step, you'll learn how to train a machine learning model using the Python packages **scikit-learn** and **revoscalepy**. These Python libraries are already installed with SQL Server Machine Learning Services, so you can load the modules and call the necessary functions from within a stored procedure. You'll train the model using the data features you just created, and then save the trained model in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table.


## Split the sample data into training and testing sets

1. Run the following T-SQL commands to create a stored procedure that will divide the data in the nyctaxi_sample table into two parts: nyctaxi\_sample\_training and nyctaxi\_sample\_testing.

    ```SQL
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[TrainTestSplit] (@pct int)
    AS
    
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dbo.nyctaxi_sample_training
    SELECT * into nyctaxi_sample_training FROM nyctaxi_sample WHERE (ABS(CAST(BINARY_CHECKSUM(medallion,hack_license)  as int)) % 100) < @pct
    
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dbo.nyctaxi_sample_testing
    SELECT * into nyctaxi_sample_testing FROM nyctaxi_sample
    WHERE (ABS(CAST(BINARY_CHECKSUM(medallion,hack_license)  as int)) % 100) > @pct
    GO
    ```

2. Run the stored procedure, and type an integer that represents the percentage of data allocated to the training set. For example, the following statement would allocate 60% of data to the training set. Training and testing data are stored in two separate tables.

    ```SQL	
    EXEC TrainTestSplit 60
    GO
    ```

## Build a logistic regression model using scikit-learn

In this section, you'll create a stored procedure that can be used to train a model using the training data you just prepared. This stored procedure defines the input data and uses a **scikit-learn** function to train a logistic regression model. You call the Python runtime that is installed with SQL Server by using the system stored procedure, [sp_execute_external_script](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md).

To make it easier to retrain the model, you can wrap the call to sp_execute_exernal_script in another stored procedure, and pass in the new training data as a parameter. This section will walk you through that process.

1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], open a new **Query** window and run the following statement to create the stored procedure _TrainTipPredictionModelSciKitPy_.  Note that the stored procedure contains a definition of the input data, so you don't need to provide an input query.

    ```SQL
    DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS TrainTipPredictionModelSciKitPy;
    GO

    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[TrainTipPredictionModelSciKitPy] (@trained_model varbinary(max) OUTPUT)
    AS
    BEGIN
      EXEC sp_execute_external_script
      @language = N'Python',
      @script = N'
      import numpy
      import pickle
      import pandas
      from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
      
      ##Create SciKit-Learn logistic regression model
      X = InputDataSet[["passenger_count", "trip_distance", "trip_time_in_secs", "direct_distance"]]
      y = numpy.ravel(InputDataSet[["tipped"]])
      
      SKLalgo = LogisticRegression()
      logitObj = SKLalgo.fit(X, y)
      
      ##Serialize model
      trained_model = pickle.dumps(logitObj)
      ',
      @input_data_1 = N'
      select tipped, fare_amount, passenger_count, trip_time_in_secs, trip_distance, 
      dbo.fnCalculateDistance(pickup_latitude, pickup_longitude,  dropoff_latitude, dropoff_longitude) as direct_distance
      from nyctaxi_sample_training
      ',
      @input_data_1_name = N'InputDataSet',
      @params = N'@trained_model varbinary(max) OUTPUT',
      @trained_model = @trained_model OUTPUT;
      ;
    END;
    GO
    ```

2. Run the following SQL statements to insert the trained model into table nyc\_taxi_models.

    ```SQL
    DECLARE @model VARBINARY(MAX);
    EXEC TrainTipPredictionModelSciKitPy @model OUTPUT;
    INSERT INTO nyc_taxi_models (name, model) VALUES('SciKit_model', @model);
    ```

    Processing of the data and fitting the model might take a couple of mins. Messages that would be piped to Python's **stdout** stream are displayed in the **Messages** window of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)]. For example:

    *STDOUT message(s) from external script:*
  *C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL14.MSSQLSERVER\PYTHON_SERVICES\lib\site-packages\revoscalepy*

3. Open the table *nyc\_taxi_models*. You can see that one new row has been added, which contains the serialized model in the column _model_.

    *linear_model*
    *0x800363736B6C6561726E2E6C696E6561....*

## Build a logistic model using the _revoscalepy_ package

Now you'll create a different stored procedure that can uses the new **revoscalepy** package to train a logistic regression model. The **revoscalepy** package for Python contains objects, transformation, and algorithms similar to those provided for the R language's **RevoScaleR** package. With this library, you can create a compute context, move data between compute contexts, transform data, and train predictive models using popular algorithms such as logistic and linear regression, decision trees, and more. For more information, see [what is revoscalepy?](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/python/what-is-revoscalepy)


1. In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], open a new Query window and run the following statement to create the stored procedure _TrainTipPredictionModelRxPy_.  This model will be based on the training data you just prepared. Because the stored procedure already includes a definition of the input data, you don't need to provide an input query.

    ```SQL
    DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS TrainTipPredictionModelRxPy;
    GO

    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[TrainTipPredictionModelRxPy] (@trained_model varbinary(max) OUTPUT)
    AS
    BEGIN
    EXEC sp_execute_external_script 
      @language = N'Python',
      @script = N'
    import numpy
    import pickle
    import pandas
    from revoscalepy.functions.RxLogit import rx_logit_ex
    
    ## Create a logistic regression model using rx_logit_ex function from revoscalepy package
    logitObj = rx_logit_ex("tipped ~ passenger_count + trip_distance + trip_time_in_secs + direct_distance", data = InputDataSet);
    
    ## Serialize model
    trained_model = pickle.dumps(logitObj)
    ',
    @input_data_1 = N'
    select tipped, fare_amount, passenger_count, trip_time_in_secs, trip_distance, 
    dbo.fnCalculateDistance(pickup_latitude, pickup_longitude,  dropoff_latitude, dropoff_longitude) as direct_distance
    from nyctaxi_sample_training
    ',
    @input_data_1_name = N'InputDataSet',
    @params = N'@trained_model varbinary(max) OUTPUT',
    @trained_model = @trained_model OUTPUT;
    ;
    END;
    GO
    ```

    This stored procedure performs the following steps as part of model training:

    - Train a logistic regression model using revoscalepy package on nyctaxi\_sample\_training data.
    - The SELECT query uses the custom scalar function _fnCalculateDistance_ to calculate the direct distance between the pick-up and drop-off locations. The results of the query are stored in the default Python input variable, `InputDataset`.
    - The Python script calls the revoscalepy's LogisticRegression function, which is included with [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../includes/rsql-productname-md.md)], to create the logistic regression model.
    - The binary variable _tipped_ is used as the *label* or outcome column,  and the model is fit using these feature columns:  _passenger_count_, _trip_distance_, _trip_time_in_secs_, and _direct_distance_.
    - The trained model, contained in the Python variable `logitObj`, is serialized and put as an output parameter [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. That output will be inserted into the database table _nyc_taxi_models_, along with its name, as a new row, so that you can retrieve and use it for future predictions.

2. Run the stored procedure as follows to insert the trained **revoscalepy** model into the table _nyc\_taxi\_models.

    ```SQL
    DECLARE @model VARBINARY(MAX);
    EXEC TrainTipPredictionModelRxPy @model OUTPUT;
    
    INSERT INTO nyc_taxi_models (name, model) VALUES('revoscalepy_model', @model);
    ```

    Processing of the data and fitting the model might take a while. Messages that would be piped to Python's **stdout** stream are displayed in the **Messages** window of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)]. For example:

    *STDOUT message(s) from external script:*
  *C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL14.MSSQLSERVER\PYTHON_SERVICES\lib\site-packages\revoscalepy*

3. Open the table *nyc_taxi_models*. You can see that one new row has been added, which contains the serialized model in the column _model_.

    *rx_model*
    *0x8003637265766F7363616c....*

In the next step you'll use the trained models to create predictions.
