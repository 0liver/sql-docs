# Python extension in SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

The Python extension is part of the SQL Server Machine Learning Services add-on to the relational database engine. It adds a Python execution environment, Anaconda distribution with standard libraries and tools, and the Microsoft Python libraries: [revoscalepy](../python/what-is-revoscalepy.md) for analytics at scale and [microsoftml](../using-the-microsoftml-package.md) for machine learning algorithms.

Python  integration is available in [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../what-is-sql-server-machine-learning.md).
