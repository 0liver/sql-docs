# R extension in SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

The R extension is part of the SQL Server Machine Learning Services add-on to the relational database engine. It adds an R execution environment, base R distribution with standard libraries and tools, and the Microsoft R libraries: [RevoScaleR](../r/revoscaler-overview.md) for analytics at scale, [MicrosoftML](../using-the-microsoftml-package.md) for machine learning algorithms, and other libraries for accesssing data or R code in SQL Server.

R integration is available in SQL Server starting in SQL Server 2016, with [R Services](../r/sql-server-r-services.md), and continuing forward as part of [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../what-is-sql-server-machine-learning.md).
