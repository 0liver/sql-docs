# Set up SQL Server Machine Learning Services (In-Database)

This topic describes how to set up Machine Learning Services in SQL Server by using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setup wizard.

**Applies to:** SQL Server 2016 R Services (R only), SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services (R and Python)

## Machine learning options in SQL Server setup

SQL Server setup provides the following options for installing machine learning:

* Install machine learning with the SQL Server database

  This option lets you run R or Python scripts by using a stored procedure. You can also use the SQL Server computer as a remote compute context for R or Python scripts that are run from an external connection.

  To install this option:
  
  * In SQL Server 2016, select **R Services (In-Database)**.
  * In SQL Server 2017, select **Machine Learning Services (In-Database)**.


* Install a standalone machine learning server

  This option creates a development environment for machine learning solutions that does not require or use SQL Server. Therefore, we generally recommend that you install this option on a different computer than the one hosting SQL Server. For more information about this option, see [Create a Standalone R Server](../r/create-a-standalone-r-server.md).

The installation process requires multiple steps, some of which are optional. The optional aspects depend on both how you plan to use machine learning and the status of your security environment. 

## <a name="bkmk_prereqs"> </a> Prerequisites

*  Avoid installing both R Server and R Services at the same time. You would ordinarily install R Server (Standalone) to create an environment that a data scientist or developer uses to connect to SQL Server and deploy R solutions. Therefore, there is no need to install both on the same computer.

* If you used any earlier versions of the Revolution Analytics development environment or the RevoScaleR packages, or if you installed any pre-release versions of SQL Server 2016, you must uninstall them. Side-by-side installation is not supported. For help removing previous versions, see [Upgrade and Installation FAQ for SQL Server R Services](../r/upgrade-and-installation-faq-sql-server-r-services.md).

* You cannot install Machine Learning Services on a failover cluster. The reason is that the security mechanism that's used for isolating external script processes is not compatible with a Windows Server failover cluster environment. As a workaround, you can do either of the following:
    * Use replication to copy necessary tables to a standalone SQL Server instance with R Services.
    * Install [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../includes/rsql-productname-md.md)] on a standalone computer that uses AlwaysOn and is part of an availability group.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After setup is complete, some additional steps are required to enable the machine learning feature. You might also need to grant users permissions to specific databases, change or configure accounts, or set up a remote data science client.

##  <a name="bkmk_installExt"></a>Step 1: Install the extensibility features and choose a machine learning language

To use machine learning, you must install SQL Server 2016 or later. To use [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../includes/rsql-productname-md.md)], at least one instance of the database engine is required. You can use either a default or named instance.

1. Run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setup.
  
    For information about how to do unattended installations, see [Unattended installs of SQL Server R Services](../r/unattended-installs-of-sql-server-r-services.md).
  
2. On the **Installation** tab, select **New SQL Server stand-alone installation or add features to an existing installation**.
   
3. On the **Feature Selection** page, to install the database services used by R jobs and installs the extensions that support external scripts and processes, select the following options:
   
   **SQL Server 2016**
   - Select **Database Engine Services**.
   - Select **R Services (In-Database)**.

   **SQL Server 2017**
   - Select **Database Engine Services**.
   - Select **Machine Learning Services (In-Database)**.
   - Select at least one machine learning language to enable. You can select only R, or you can add both R and Python.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you do not select either the R or Python language options, the setup wizard installs only the extensibility framework, which includes SQL Server Trusted Launchpad, but it does not install any language-specific components. This option is for binding the SQL Server instance to R or Python as a part of the Microsoft Modern Lifecycle Policy. For more information, see [Use SqlBindR to upgrade an instance of R Services](use-sqlbindr-exe-to-upgrade-an-instance-of-sql-server.md).

4.  On the **Consent to Install Microsoft R Open** page, select **Accept**.
  
     This license agreement is required to download Microsoft R Open, which includes a distribution of the open source R base packages and tools, together with enhanced R packages and connectivity providers from the Microsoft R development team.
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If the computer that you're using does not have internet access, you can pause setup at this point to download the installers separately, as described in [Install R components without internet access](installing-ml-components-without-internet-access.md).
  
5. Select **Next**.

6. On the **Ready to Install** page, verify that the following items are included, and then select **Install**.

   **SQL Server 2017**
   - Database Engine Services
   - Machine Learning Services (In-Database)
   - R or Python, or both

   **SQL Server 2016**
   - Database Engine Services
   - R Services (In-Database)

7. When the installation is complete, restart your computer.

##  <a name="bkmk_enableFeature"></a>Step 2: Enable external script services

1. Open [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. If it is not already installed, you can rerun the SQL Server setup wizard to open a download link and install it.
  
2. Connect to the instance where you installed machine learning, and then run the following command:

   ```SQL
   sp_configure
   ```

    The value for the **external scripts enabled** property should now be **0**. That is because the feature is turned off by default to reduce the surface area, and it must be explicitly enabled by an administrator.
     
3. To enable the external scripting feature, run the following statement:
  
    ```SQL
    EXEC sp_configure  'external scripts enabled', 1
    RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE
    ```
  
4. Restart the SQL Server service for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. Restarting the SQL Server service also automatically restarts the related [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)] service.

    You can restart the service by using the **Services** panel in Control Panel or by using SQL Server Configuration Manager.

## <a name="bkmk_TestScript"></a>Step 3: Verify that the script execution works locally

Verify that the external script execution service is enabled.

1. In SQL Server Management Studio, open a new **Query** window, and then run the following command:
  
    ```SQL
    EXEC sp_configure  'external scripts enabled'
    ```
    The **run_value** should now be set to 1.
    
2. Open the **Services** panel, and verify that the Launchpad service for your instance is running. If you install multiple instances, each instance has its own Launchpad service.
   
3. Open a new **Query** window in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], and then run a simple R script such as the following:
  
    ```SQL
    EXEC sp_execute_external_script  @language =N'R',
    @script=N'
	OutputDataSet <- InputDataSet;
	',
    @input_data_1 =N'SELECT 1 AS hello'
    WITH RESULT SETS (([hello] int not null));
    GO
    ```
  
    **Results**
  
    *hello*
    *1*
  
   If the command executes without an error, go on to the next steps. If you get an error, for a list of some common problems, see [Upgrade and installation FAQ](../r/upgrade-and-installation-faq-sql-server-r-services.md).

## <a name="bkmk_FollowUp"></a>Step 4: Additional configuration

Depending on your use case for R or Python, you might need to make additional changes to the server, the firewall, the accounts used by the service, or database permissions. The changes you must make vary by case.

Common scenarios that require additional changes include:

* Changing firewall rules to allow inbound connections to SQL Server.
* Enabling additional network protocols.
* Ensuring that the server supports remote connections.
* Enabling *implied authentication*, if users access SQL Server data from a remote R development terminal and execute R code by using the RODBC package or other Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) provider.
* Giving users permissions to run R script or use databases.
* Fixing security issues that prevent communication with the Launchpad service.
* Ensuring that users have permission to run R code or install packages.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all the listed changes might be required. However, we recommend that you review all items to see whether they are applicable to your scenario.

### <a name="bkmk_configureAccounts"></a>Enable implied authentication for the Launchpad account group

During setup, some new Windows user accounts are created for running tasks under the security token of the [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad_md](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)] service. When a user sends an R script from an external client, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] activates an available worker account, maps it to the identity of the calling user, and runs the R script on behalf of the user. This new service of the database engine supports the secure execution of external scripts, called *implied authentication*.

You can view these accounts in the Windows user group **SQLRUserGroup**. By default, 20 worker accounts are created, which is usually more than enough for running R jobs.

However, if you need to run R scripts from a remote data science client and are using Windows authentication, you must grant these worker accounts permission to sign in to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance on your behalf.

1. In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], in Object Explorer, expand **Security**, right-click **Logins**, and select **New Login**.
2. In the **Login - New** dialog box, select **Search**.
3. Select the **Object Types** and **Groups** check boxes, and clear all other check boxes.
4. Click **Advanced**, verify that the location to search is the current computer, and then click **Find Now**.
5. Scroll through the list of group accounts on the server until you find one beginning with `SQLRUserGroup`.
    
    + The name of the group that's associated with the Launchpad service for the _default instance_ is always just **SQLRUserGroup**. Select this account only for the default instance.
    + If you are using a _named instance_, the instance name is appended to the default name, `SQLRUserGroup`. Hence, if your instance is named "MLTEST", the default user group name for this instance would be **SQLRUserGroupMLTest**.
5. Click **OK** to close the advanced search dialog box, and verify that you've selected the correct account for the instance. Each instance can use only its own Launchpad service and the group created for that service.
6. Click **OK** once more to close the **Select User or Group** dialog box.
7. In the **Login - New** dialog box, click **OK**. By default, the login is assigned to the **public** role and has permission to connect to the database engine.

### <a name="bkmk_AllowLogon"></a>Give users permission to run external scripts

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a SQL login for running R scripts in a SQL Server compute context, this step is not required.

If you installed [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and are running R scripts in your own instance, you are usually executing scripts as an administrator, or at least as a database owner, and thus have implicit permissions for various operations, all data in the database, and the ability to install new R packages as needed.

However, in an enterprise scenario, most users, including users who access the database by using SQL logins, do not have such elevated permissions. Therefore, for each user who will be running R or Python scripts, you must grant the user permissions to run scripts in each database where external scripts will be used.

```SQL
USE <database_name>
GO
GRANT EXECUTE ANY EXTERNAL SCRIPT  TO [UserName]
```

> [!TIP]
> Need help with setup? Not sure you have run all the steps? Use these custom reports to check the installation status of R Services. For more information, see [Monitor R Services using Custom Reports](monitor-r-services-using-custom-reports-in-management-studio.md).

### Ensure that the SQL Server computer supports remote connections

If you cannot connect from a remote computer, check to see whether the server permits remote connections. Remote connections are sometimes disabled by default.

Also check to see whether the firewall allows access to SQL Server. By default, the port used by SQL Server is often blocked by the firewall. If you are using the Windows Firewall, see [Configure Windows Firewall for database engine access](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-windows-firewall-for-database-engine-access.md).

### Give your users read, write, or DDL permissions to the database

While it is running R scripts, the user account or SQL login might need to read data from other databases, create new tables to store results, and write data into tables.

For each user account or SQL login that will be executing R scripts, be sure that the account or login has the appropriate permissions on the database: *db_datareader*, *db_datawriter*, or *db_ddladmin*.

For example, the following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement gives the SQL login *MySQLLogin* the rights to run T-SQL queries in the *RSamples* database. To run this statement, the SQL login must already exist in the security context of the server.

```SQL
USE RSamples
GO
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datareader', 'MySQLLogin'
```

For more information about the permissions included in each role, see [Database-level roles](../../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/database-level-roles.md).

### Use machine learning in an Azure VM

If you installed Machine Learning Services (or R Services) on an Azure virtual machine, you might need to change some additional defaults. For more information, see [Installing SQL Server Machine Learning on an Azure virtual machine](installing-sql-server-r-services-on-an-azure-virtual-machine.md).

### Create an ODBC data source for the instance on your data science client

If you create an R solution on a data science client computer and need to run code by using the SQL Server computer as the compute context, you can use either a SQL login or integrated Windows authentication.

* For SQL logins: Ensure that the login has appropriate permissions on the database where you will be reading data. You can do so by adding *Connect to* and *SELECT* permissions, or by adding the login to the *db_datareader* role. For logins that need to create objects, add *DDL_admin* rights. For logins that must save data to tables, add the login to the *db_datawriter* role.

* For Windows authentication: You might need to configure an ODBC data source on the data science client that specifies the instance name and other connection information. For more information, see [ODBC data source administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/odbc/admin/odbc-data-source-administrator).

## Next steps

After you have verified that the script-execution feature works in SQL Server, you can run R and Python commands from SQL Server Management Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other client that can send T-SQL statements to the server.

However, you might want to make some changes to the system configuration to support heavy use of machine learning, or add new R packages.

This section lists some common modifications you can make to support machine learning.

### Add more worker accounts

If you think you might use R heavily, or if you expect many users to be running scripts concurrently, you can increase the number of worker accounts that are assigned to the Launchpad service. For more information, see [Modify the user account pool for SQL Server R Services](modify-the-user-account-pool-for-sql-server-r-services.md).

### <a name="bkmk_optimize"></a>Optimize the server for external script execution

The default settings for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setup are intended to optimize the balance of the server for a variety of services that are supported by the database engine, which might include extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes, reporting, auditing, and applications that use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data. Therefore, under the default settings, you might find that resources for machine learning are sometimes restricted or throttled, particularly in memory-intensive operations.

To ensure that machine learning jobs are prioritized and resourced appropriately, we recommend that you use SQL Server Resource Governor to configure an external resource pool. You might also want to change the amount of memory that's allocated to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database engine, or increase the number of accounts that run under the [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)] service.

- To configure a resource pool for managing external resources, see [Create an external resource pool](../../t-sql/statements/create-external-resource-pool-transact-sql.md).
  
- To change the amount of memory reserved for the database, see [Server memory configuration options](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-memory-server-configuration-options.md).
  
- To change the number of R accounts that can be started by [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)], see [Modify the user account pool for machine learning](modify-the-user-account-pool-for-sql-server-r-services.md).

If you are using Standard Edition and do not have Resource Governor, you can use Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and Extended Events, as well as Windows event monitoring, to help manage the server resources that are used by R. For more information, see [Monitoring and managing R Services](managing-and-monitoring-r-solutions.md).

### Install additional R packages

Take a minute to install any additional R packages you'll be using.

Packages that you want to use from SQL Server must be installed in the default library that is used by the instance. If you have a separate installation of R on the computer, or if you installed packages to user libraries, you won't be able to use those packages from T-SQL. For more information,  see [Install additional R packages on SQL Server](../../advanced-analytics/r-services/install-additional-r-packages-on-sql-server.md).

You can also set up user groups to share packages on a per-database level, or configure database roles to enable users to install their own packages. For more information, see [Package management](r-package-management-for-sql-server-r-services.md).

### Upgrade the machine learning components

When you install R Services using SQL Server 2016, you get the version of the R components that was up to date when the release or service pack was published. Each time you patch or upgrade the server, the machine learning components are upgraded as well.

However, you can upgrade the machine learning components on a faster schedule than is supported by SQL Server releases, by installing Microsoft R Server and binding your instance. When you upgrade, you also get the following new features, which are supported in recent releases of Microsoft R Server:

* New R packages, including [sqlrutils](https://docs.microsoft.com/r-server/r-reference/sqlrutils/sqlrutils), [olapR](https://docs.microsoft.com/r-server/r-reference/olapr/olapr), and [MicrosoftML](https://docs.microsoft.com/r-server/r-reference/microsoftml/microsoftml-package).
* [Pretrained models](https://docs.microsoft.com/r-server/install/microsoftml-install-pretrained-models) for image classification and text analysis.

For information about how to upgrade a SQL Server 2016 instance, see [Upgrade R components through binding](use-sqlbindr-exe-to-upgrade-an-instance-of-sql-server.md).

If you are not sure which version of R is associated with the instance, you can run a command such as the following:

```SQL
EXEC sp_execute_external_script  @language =N'R',
@script=N'
myvar <- version$version.string
OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(myvar);'
```

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrades via the binding process will be supported for SQL Server 2017 as well. However, currently upgrades are supported only for SQL Server 2016 instances.
