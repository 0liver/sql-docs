# Using R in Azure SQL Database

In October 2017, the SQL Server development team announced plans to support execution of R code in-database using stored procedures, similar to R Services in SQL Server 2016.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The initial preview release that was announced was intended for testing and exploration only. Currently, the feature is **disabled** in Azure SQL Database to support further development. 

To keep up to date on the the public release schedule and upcoming events, see the [SQL Server blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/dataplatforminsider/) or the [Microsoft R Server blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rserver/).

**Azure resources**

In the meantime, we recommend that you use one of the SQL Server 2017 virtual machines that are available on the Azure Marketplace: 

+ [Provision a virtual machine for machine learning on Azure](provision-the-r-server-only-sql-server-2016-enterprise-vm-on-azure.md)

Also check out these VMs, which come preconfigured with a variety of popular machine learning tools:

+ [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview)
+ [Deep Learning Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/deep-learning-dsvm-overview),
