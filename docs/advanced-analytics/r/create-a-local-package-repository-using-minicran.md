# Create a local package repository using miniCRAN
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

The [miniCRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/miniCRAN/index.html)  package was created by Andre de Vries to support these common scenarios: 

+ Analyzing package dependencies for a single package or set of packages
+ Preparing a set of R packages for installation onto a server without internet access.

The user specifies a set of desired packages, and miniCRAN recursively reads the dependency tree for these packages, and downloads only the listed packages and their dependencies from CRAN or similar repositories.

As an output, miniCRAN creates an internally consistent repository consisting of the selected packages and all required dependencies. You can then move this local repository to the server, and proceed to install the packages without using the internet.

Experienced R users often look for the list of dependent packages in the DESCRIPTION file for the downloaded package. However, packages listed in **Imports** might have second-level dependencies. For this reason, we recommend use of the **miniCRAN** method.

## What is a package repository

The goal of creating a local package repository is to provide a single location that a server administrator or other users in the organization can use to install new R packages on a server that does not have internet access. After creating the repository, you can modify it by adding new packages or upgrading the version of existing packages.

The [miniCRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/miniCRAN/index.html) package for R was written by [Andre de Vries](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/05/minicran-sql-server.html) to make it easier to create a consistent, managed set of R packages for an organization. 

Package repositories are useful in these scenarios:

- **Security**: Many R users are accustomed to downloading and installing new R packages at will, from CRAN or one of its mirror sites. However, for security reasons, production servers running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](..\..\includes\ssnoversion-md.md)] typically do not have internet connectivity.

- **Easier offline installation**: To install package to an offline server requires that you also download all package dependencies, Using miniCRAN makes it easier to get all dependencies in the correct format.

    By using miniCRAN, you can avoid package dependency errors when preparing packages to install with the [CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-external-library-transact-sql) statement.

- **Improved version management**: In a multiuser environment, there are good reasons to avoid unrestricted installation of multiple package versions on the server. Use a local repository to provide a consistent set of packages for use by your analysts. 

> [!TIP]
> You can also use miniCRAN to prepare packages for use in Azure Machine Learning. For more information, see this blog: [Using miniCRAN in Azure ML, by Michele Usuelli](https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-minicran-in-azure-ml/) 

## Prepare packages using miniCRAN

The **miniCRAN** package itself is dependent on 18 other CRAN packages, among which is the **RCurl** package, which has a system dependency on the **curl-devel** package. Similarly, package **XML** has a dependency on **libxml2-devel**. 

For these reasons, we recommend that you build your local repository initially on a machine with full Internet access, so that you can easily satisfy all these dependencies. 

After the repository has been created, you can move the repository to a different location.

### Step 1. Install the miniCRAN package

You begin by creating a **miniCRAN** repository to use as a source. You should create this repository on a computer that has internet access.

1. Install the **miniCRAN** package and the required **igraph** package. This example checks for whether the package is already installed, but you can bypass the if statements and install the packages directly.

    ```R
    if(!require("miniCRAN")) install.packages("miniCRAN") 
    if(!require("igraph")) install.packages("igraph") 
    library("miniCRAN")
    ```

### Step 2. Define a package source: a CRAN mirror, or an MRAN snapshot

1. Specify a mirror site to use in getting packages. For example, you could use the MRAN site, or any other site in your region that contains the packages you need. If download fails, try another mirror site.

    ```R
    CRAN_mirror <- c(CRAN = "https://mran.microsoft.com")
    CRAN_mirror <- c(CRAN = "https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu")
    ```

2. Type the name of a local folder in which to store the collected packages. 

    Be sure to create the folder in advance. An error is raised if the `local_repo` folder does not exist when you run the R code later.

    The folder should have a descriptive name. Here we've used "miniCRAN", but if you repeat this often, you should probably use a more descriptive name, such as "miniCRANZooPackages" or "miniCRANMyRPackagev2".

    ```R
    local_repo <- "~/miniCRAN"
    ```

    The tilde expansion operator returns an environment variable, with results equivalent to `Sys.getenv("R_USER")`.

### Step 3. Add packages to the repository

1. After **miniCRAN** is installed, create a list that specifies the additional packages you want to download.

    Do **not** add dependencies to this initial list. The **igraph** package used by **miniCRAN** generates the list of dependencies for you. For more information about how to use the generated dependency graph, see [Using miniCRAN to identify package
    dependencies](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/miniCRAN/vignettes/miniCRAN-dependency-graph.html).

    The following R script adds the target packages, "zoo"
    and "forecast" to a variable.

    ```R
    pkgs_needed <- c("zoo", "forecast")
    ```
2. It is not required that you plot the dependency graph, but it can be informative.
    
    ```R
    plot(makeDepGraph(pkgs_needed))
    ```

3. Create the local repo. Be sure to change the R version if necessary

    ```R
    pkgs_expanded <- pkgDep(pkgs_needed, repos = CRAN_mirror);
    makeRepo(pkgs_expanded, path = local_repo, repos = CRAN_mirror, type = "win.binary", Rversion = "3.3");
    ```

    From this information, the miniCRAN package creates the folder structure that you need to copy the packages to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](..\..\includes\ssnoversion-md.md)] later.

4. At this point you should have a folder containing the packages you needed, and any additional packages that were required.

    You can run the following code to list the packages contained in the miniCRAN repository.

    ```R
    pdb <- as.data.frame(pkgAvail(local_repo, type = "win.binary", Rversion = "3.3"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE);
    head(pdb);
    pdb$Package;
    pdb[, c("Package", "Version", "License")]
    ```

### Step 4. Use the repository to add R packages to the instance library

After you have created the repository and added the packages you need, you must move the package repository to the server computer, and ensure that the R packages are installed in the correct library for use from SQL Server.

The following procedure describes how to install the packages using R tools.

1. Copy the folder containing the miniCRAN repository, in its entirety, to the server where you plan to install the packages. The folder typically has this structure: miniCRAN root> -> bin -> windows -> contrib -> version no -> all packages.

2. Open an R command prompt using the R tool associated with the instance.

    - For SQL Server 2017, the default folder is `C:/Program Files/Microsoft SQL Server/MSSQL14.MSSQLSERVER/R_SERVICES/library`.

    - For SQL Server 2016, the default folder is `C:/Program Files/Microsoft SQL Server/MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER/R_SERVICES/library`.

    - For a named instance, the default path would be something like: `<instance_path>.RTEST/R_SERVICES/library`.

    -  If you have installed SQL Server to a different drive, or made any other changes in the installation path, be sure to make those changes as well.

3. Get the path for the instance library, and add it to the list of library paths.

    ```R
    .libPaths()[1];
    lib <- .libPaths()[1]
    ```

    On SQL Server, this command should return the path of the library associated with the instance, such as: "C:/Program Files/Microsoft SQL Server/MSSQL14.MSSQLSERVER/R_SERVICES/library "

4. Specify the new location on the server where you copied the **miniCRAN** repository, as `server_repo`.

    In this example, we assume that you copied the repository to a temporary folder on the server.

    ```R
    source_repo <- "C:\\temp\\miniCRAN"
    ```

5. Since you are working in a new R workspace on the server, you must also furnish the list of packages to install.

    ```R
    tspackages <- c("zoo", "forecast")
    ```

6. Install the packages, providing the path to the local copy of the miniCRAN repo.

    ```R
    install.packages(tspackages, repos = file.path("file://", normalizePath;(source_repo, winslash = "/")), lib = lib, type = "win.binary", dependencies = TRUE);
    ```

7. From the instance library, you can view the installed packages using a command like the following:

    ```R
    installed.packages()
    ```

> [!NOTE] 
> To use the package in SQL Server, the packages must be installed into the default library used by the instance. 

## Manually install a single package from a zipped file

If you are installing a single package that has no dependencies, or you cannot use **miniCRAN**, you can also manually download the package you need. To do this requires that you are either an administrator or sole owner of a server.

After downloading the packages, you install the R packages from the zipped file location.

1. Download the package as a zipped file, and save it in a local folder

2. Copy that folder to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](..\..\includes\ssnoversion-md.md)] computer.

3. Install the packages into the SQL Server instance library using conventional R commands. If the package has dependencies that are not already installed, and you have not included them, installation might fail. 

You can also upload individual packages into an instance of SQL Server 2017, by using the [CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-external-library-transact-sql). This process also required administrative access.
