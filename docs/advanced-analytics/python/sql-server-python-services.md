# SQL Server Machine Learning Services with Python
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

Python is a language that offers great flexibility and power for a variety of machine learning tasks. Open source libraries for Python include several platforms for customizable neural networks, as well as popular libraries for natural language processing. Now, this widely-used language is supported in SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning.

Because Python is integrated with the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database engine, you can keep analytics close to the data and eliminate the costs and security risks associated with data movement.  You can deploy machine learning solutions based on Python using convenient, familiar tools such as Visual Studio. Your production applications can get predictions, models, or visuals from the Python 3.5 runtime by simply calling a T-SQL stored procedure.

This release includes the Anaconda distribution of Python, as well as the [revoscalepy](../python/what-is-revoscalepy.md) library, to improve the scale and performance of your machine learning solutions.
