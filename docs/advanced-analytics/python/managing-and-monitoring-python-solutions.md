# Monitoring Python in SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

Support for Python is a new feature in SQL Server, available beginning with SQL Server 2017.

The overall framework for external script execution and data security is the same as for R. You can monitor any external script, including one that runs Python, using the same framework that was provided for R script execution in SQL Server 2016. For more information, see [Monitoring R Solutions](../r/managing-and-monitoring-r-solutions.md).
