1. Launch the separate Windows-based installer for either [R Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/rebranding-microsoft-r-server) or [Machine Learning Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/install/machine-learning-server-windows-install).

2. Select the languages that you wish to update, and select the **Pre-trained Models** option.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you have previously run the installer to update R Server (Standalone), and just want to add the pre-trained models, leave all previous selections **as is**, and select just the Pre**-trained Models** option. **Do not** deselect any previously selected options; if you do so, the installer removes the components.

    We recommend that you accept default settings for the model locations.

3. Click **Continue**.

4. Accept all other prompts, including license agreements.

After installation is complete, you must perform some additional steps to register the pre-trained models.

1. Open a Windows command prompt **as administrator**.

2. Navigate to the setup bootstrap folder for R Server (Standalone), which also contains the Microsoft R installer.

3. Run `RSetup.exe` and indicate the component to install, the version, and the folder containing the model source files, using this syntax:

    `RSetup.exe /install /component MLM /version <version> /language 1033 /destdir "~\R_SERVER\library\MicrosoftML\mxLibs\x64"`

    The following values are supported for the version parameter:

**R tools**


When you install R with SQL Server, you get the same R tools that are installed with any **base** installation of R, such as RGui, Rterm, and so forth. Therefore technically, you have all the tools you need to develop and test R code.

The following standard R tools are included in a *base installation* of R, and therefore are installed by default.

+ **RTerm**: A command-line terminal for running R scripts

+ **RGui.exe**:  A simple interactive editor for R. The command-line arguments are the same for RGui.exe and RTerm.

+ **RScript**: A command-line tool for running R scripts in batch mode.

To locate these tools, determine the R library that was installed when you set up SQL Server or the standalone machine learning feature. For example, in a default installation, the R tools are located in these folders:

+ SQL Server 2016 R Services: `~\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.<instancename>\R_SERVICES\bin\x64`
+ Microsoft R Server Standalone: `~\Program Files\Microsoft R\R_SERVER\bin\x64`
+ SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services: `~\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL14.<instancename>\R_SERVICES\bin\x64`
+ Machine Learning Server (Standalone): `~\Program Files\Microsoft\ML Server\R_SERVER\bin\x64`

If you need help with the R tools, just open **RGui**, click **Help**, and select one of the options

**Microsoft R Client**


Microsoft R Client is a free download that gives you access to the RevoScaleR packages for development use. By installing R Client, you can create R solutions that can be run in all supported compute contexts, including SQL Server in-database analytics, and distributed R computing on Hadoop, Spark, or Linux using Machine Learning Server.

If you have already installed a different R development environment, such as RStudio, be sure to reconfigure the environment to use the libraries and executables provided by Microsoft R Client. By doing so you can use all the features of the RevoScaleR package, although performance will be limited.

Choose the best language for the task. R is best for statistical computations that are difficult to implement using SQL. For set-based operations over data, leverage the power of  *{Included-Content-Goes-Here}*  to achieve maximum performance. Use the in-memory database engine for very fast computations over columns.

**Step 4: Optimize your solution**


When the model is ready to scale on enterprise data, the data scientist often works with the DBA or SQL developer to optimize processes such as:

+ Feature engineering
+ Data ingestion and data transformation
+ Scoring

Traditionally data scientists using R have had problems with both performance and scale, especially when using large dataset. That is because the common runtime implementation is single-threaded and can accommodate only those data sets that fit into the available memory on the local computer. Integration with SQl Server Machine Learning Services provides multiple features for better performance, with more data:

+ **RevoScaleR**: This R package contains implementations of some of the most popular R functions, redesigned to provide parallelism and scale. The package also includes functions that further boost  performance and scale by pushing computations to the  *{Included-Content-Goes-Here}*  computer, which typically has far greater memory and computational power.

+ **revoscalepy**. This Python library, available in SQL Server 2017, implements the most popular functions in RevoScaleR, such as remote compute contexts, and many algorithms that support distributed processing.

**Resources**

+ [Performance Case Study]
+ [R and Data Optimization]

**Step 5: Deploy and Consume**

2. Note that the index values aren't output, even if you use the index to get specific values from the data.frame.

    **Results**

    |ResultValue|
    |------|
    |0.5|
    |2|

**Output values into data.frame using an index**


Let's see how conversion to a data.frame works with our two series containing the results of simple math operations. The first has an index of sequential values generated by Python. The second uses an arbitrary index of string values.

1. This example gets a value from the series that uses an integer index.

```
    EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script
    @language = N'Python',
    @script = N'
    import pandas as pd
    a = 1
    b = 2
    c = a/b
    d = a*b
    s = pandas.Series([c,d])
    print(s)
    df = pd.DataFrame(s, index=[1])
    OutputDataSet = df
    '
    WITH RESULT SETS (( ResultValue float ))
```

Remember that the auto-generated index starts at 0. Try using an out of range index value and see what happens.

2. Now let's get a single value from the other data frame that has a string index.

```
    EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script
    @language = N'Python',
    @script = N'
    import pandas as pd
    a = 1
    b = 2
    c = a/b
    s = pandas.Series(c, index =["simple math example 1", "simple math example 2"])
    print(s)
    df = pd.DataFrame(s, index=["simple math example 1"])
    OutputDataSet = df
    '
    WITH RESULT SETS (( ResultValue float ))
```

**Results**

|ResultValue|
|------|
|0.5|

If you try to use a numeric index to get a value from this series, you get an error.

If you installed a pre-release version of SQL Server 2017, you should update to at least the RTM version. Later service releases have continued to expand and improve Python functionality. Some features of this tutorial might not work in early pre-release versions.

+ This example uses a predefined Python environment, named `PYTEST_SQL_SERVER`. The environment has been configured to contain **revoscalepy** and other required libraries.

    If you do not have an environment configured to run Python, you must do so separately. A discussion of how to create or modify Python environments is out of scope for this tutorial. For more information about how to set up a Python client that contains the correct libraries, see [Install Python client](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/install/python-libraries-interpreter) and [Link Python to tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/python/quickstart-python-tools).

**Remote compute contexts and revoscalepy**


This sample demonstrates the process of creating a Python model in a remote _compute context_, which lets you work from a client, but choose a remote environment, such as SQL Server, Spark, or Machine Learning Server, where the operations are actually performed. Using compute contexts makes it easier to write code once and deploy it to any supported environment.

To execute Python code in SQL Server requires the **revoscalepy** package. This is a special Python package provided by Microsoft, similar to the **RevoScaleR** package for the R language. The **revoscalepy** package supports the creation of compute contexts, and provides the infrastructure for passing data and models between a local workstation and a remote server. The **revoscalepy** function that supports in-database code execution is [RxInSqlServer](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/python-reference/revoscalepy/rxinsqlserver).
