# Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to SQL Database. SSMS provides tools to configure, monitor, and administer instances of SQL from wherever you deploy it. With SSMS you can deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier components used by your applications, as well as build queries and scripts. 

This release features improved compatibility with previous versions of SQL Server, a stand-alone web installer, and toast notifications within SSMS when new releases become available.

* There is no explicit block for SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005, but some features may not work properly.  
* Additionally, SSMS 17.X can be installed side by side with SSMS 16.X or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier. 
  
## Supported Operating systems
  
This release of SSMS supports the following platforms when used with the latest available service pack:   
- Windows 10
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 8
- Windows 7 (SP1)
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 (64-bit)

>[!NOTE]
>SSMS 17.X is based on the Visual Studio 2015 Isolated shell, which was released before Windows Server 2016. Microsoft takes app compatibility seriously and ensures that already-shipped applications continue to run on the latest Windows releases. To minimize issues running SSMS Windows Server 2016, ensure SSMS has all of the latest updates applied. If you experience any issues with SSMS on Windows Server 2016, contact support. Support determines if the issue is with SSMS, Visual Studio, or with Windows compatibility, and the issue is directed to the appropriate team.

## SSMS installation tips and issues
**Minimize Installation Reboots**

- Take the following actions to reduce the chances of SSMS setup requiring a reboot at the end of installation:
  - Make sure you are running an up-to-date version of the Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package. Version 12.00.40649.5 (or greater) is required. Only the x64 version is needed.
  - Verify the version of .NET Framework on the computer is 4.6.1 (or greater).
  - Close any other instances of Visual Studio that are open on the computer.
  - Make sure all the latest OS updates are installed on the computer.
  - The noted actions are typically required one once. There are few cases where a reboot is required during additional upgrades to the same major version of SSMS. For minor upgrades, all the prerequirements for SSMS will already be installed on the computer.

- To see the list of known issues and work-arounds, see [SQL Server Management Studio -  Release Notes](../ssms/sql-server-management-studio-release-notes.md)
