Version 17.6 includes:

**General SSMS**

SQL Database Managed Instance:

- Added a support for [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance). Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (preview) is a new flavor of Azure SQL Database, providing near 100% compatibility with SQL Server on-premises, a native [virtual network (VNet)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) implementation that addresses common security concerns, and a [business model](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/) favorable for on-premises SQL Server customers.
- Support for common management scenarios like:
   - Create and alter databases.
   - Backup and restore databases.
   - Importing, exporting, extracting and publishing Data-tier Applications.
   - Viewing and altering Server properties.
   - Full Object Explorer support.
   - Scripting database objects.
   - Support for SQL Agent jobs.
   - Support for Linked Servers.
- Learn more about Managed Instances [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/migrate-your-databases-to-a-fully-managed-service-with-azure-sql-database-managed-instance/).


Object Explorer:
- Added settings to not force brackets around names when dragging & dropping from Object Explorer to Query Window. (User suggestions [32911933](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32911933), and [32671051](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32671051).)

Data Classification:
- General improvements and bug fixes.

**Integration Services (IS)**

- Added support to deploy packages to a [SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance).

## Supported SQL offerings

* This version of SSMS works with all [supported versions of SQL Server 2008 - SQL Server 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle?C2=1044) and provides the greatest level of support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
* Use SSMS 17.x to connect to [SQL Server on Linux](../linux/sql-server-linux-overview.md).
* Additionally, SSMS 17.x can be installed side by side with SSMS 16.x or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier.
* SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) - SSMS version 17.x does not support connecting to the legacy SQL Server Integration Services service. To connect to an earlier version of the legacy Integration Services, use the version of SSMS aligned with the version of SQL Server. For example, use SSMS 16.x to connect to the legacy SQL Server 2016 Integration Services service. SSMS 17.x and SSMS 16.x can be installed side-by-side on the same computer. Since the release of SQL Server 2012, the SSIS Catalog database, SSISDB, is the recommended way to store, manage, run, and monitor Integration Services packages. For details, see [SSIS Catalog](../integration-services/catalog/ssis-catalog.md).

## Supported Operating systems
  
This release of SSMS supports the following 64-bit platforms when used with the latest available service pack:
- Windows 10 (64-bit)
- Windows 8.1 (64-bit)
- Windows 8 (64-bit)
- Windows 7 (SP1) (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2016 *
- Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2012 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)

\* SSMS 17.X is based on the Visual Studio 2015 Isolated shell, which was released before Windows Server 2016. Microsoft takes app compatibility seriously and ensures that already-shipped applications continue to run on the latest Windows releases. To minimize issues running SSMS on Windows Server 2016, ensure SSMS has all of the latest updates applied. If you experience any issues with SSMS on Windows Server 2016, contact support. The support team determines if the issue is with SSMS, Visual Studio, or with Windows compatibility. The support team then routes the issue to the appropriate team for further investigation.

## SSMS installation tips and issues

### Minimize Installation Reboots

* Take the following actions to reduce the chances of SSMS setup requiring a reboot at the end of installation:
  * Make sure you are running an up-to-date version of the Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package. Version 12.0.40649.5 (or greater) is required. Only the x64 version is needed.
  * Verify the version of .NET Framework on the computer is 4.6.1 (or greater).
  * Close any other instances of Visual Studio that are open on the computer.
  * Make sure all the latest OS updates are installed on the computer.
  * The noted actions are typically required only once. There are few cases where a reboot is required during additional upgrades to the same major version of SSMS. For minor upgrades, all the prerequirements for SSMS are already be installed on the computer.
