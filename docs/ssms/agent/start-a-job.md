# Start a Job

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This article describes how to start running a [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent job in [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using SQL Server Management Studio, [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] or SQL Server Management Objects.

A job is a specified series of actions that [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent performs. [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs can run on one local server or on multiple remote servers.

- **Before you begin:**

    [Security](#Security)

- **To start a job, using:**

    [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMS)

    [Transact-SQL](#TSQL)

    [SQL Server Management Objects](#SMO)

## <a id="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin

### <a id="Security"></a> Security

For detailed information, see [Implement SQL Server Agent Security](../../ssms/agent/implement-sql-server-agent-security.md).

## <a id="SSMS"></a> Use SQL Server Management Studio

1. In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE [ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and then expand that instance.

1. Expand **SQL Server Agent,** and expand **Jobs**. Depending on how you want the job to start, do one of the following:

    - If you are working on a single server, or working on a target server, or running a local server job on a master server, right-click the job you want to start, and then select **Start Job**.

    - If you want to start multiple jobs, right-click **Job Activity Monitor**, and then select **View Job Activity**. In the Job Activity Monitor you can select multiple jobs, right-click your selection, and select **Start Jobs**.

    - If you are working on a master server and want all targeted servers to run the job simultaneously, right-click the job you want to start, select **Start Job**, and then select **Start on all targeted servers**.

    - If you are working on a master server and want to specify target servers for the job, right-click the job you want to start, select **Start Job**, and then select **Start on specific target servers**. In the **Post Download Instructions** dialog box, select the **These target servers** check box, and then select each target server on which this job should run.

## <a id="TSQL"></a> Use Transact-SQL

1. In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].

1. On the Standard bar, select **New Query**.

1. Copy and paste the following example into the query window and select **Execute**.

    ```sql
    -- starts a job named Weekly Sales Data Backup.
    USE msdb ;
    GO

    EXEC dbo.sp_start_job N'Weekly Sales Data Backup' ;
    GO
    ```

For more information, see [sp_start_job (Transact-SQL)](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-start-job-transact-sql.md).

## <a id="SMO"></a> Use SQl PowerShell

To start a job, call the Start method of the Job class by using a programming language of your choice, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. Hereâ€™s an example using PowerShell:

```powershell
# Load the SMO assembly
Add-Type -AssemblyName "Microsoft.SqlServer.SMO"

# Create a server object
$server = New-Object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server "MyServerInstance"

# Get the job you want to start
$job = $server.JobServer.Jobs["Weekly Sales Data Backup"]

# Start the job
$job.Start()
```

## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects

Call the **Start** method of the **Job** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. For more information, see [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/sql-server-management-objects-smo-programming-guide.md).  

For more information, see SQL Server Management Objects (SMO).
