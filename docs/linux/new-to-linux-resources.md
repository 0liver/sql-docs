# New to Linux resources for SQL users

This article is intended to provide resources to SQL Server users that
are new to the Linux environment.

Before we get started with SQL Server on Linux module. It is necessary to
understand the basics of Linux, some vital concepts that you need to be
familiar with before you go further with this learning module on SQL on
Linux are:

> 1\) What is Linux
>
> 2\) Selecting a Linux Distribution
>
> 3\) Getting around in Linux directories.
>
> 4\) Installing a new software (Debian, Redhat)
>
> 5\) When to work as root and where to work as system user.
>
> 6\) Linux file systems & file permissions -chmod/chown
>
> 7\) Commands for System Administration like
> (df/du/TOP/ps/mkdir/rmdir/rm/mv etc)

 

This is not a comprehensive list but the bare minimum topics,
you need to be aware of to help you administrate and navigate your SQL
on Linux environments.

So, let's get started.

## What is Linux?

[This](https://www.linux.org/threads/what-is-linux.4106/) module talks
about the history of Linux as the operating system. It also talks about
'The Kernel' and where Linux is today. This tutorial should help you get
started with the introduction to Linux.

## Selecting a Linux Distribution:

After you know the history of Linux, it's time to understand which
distribution of Linux you choose to get started with SQL Server on
Linux. SQL Server is supported on various distributions like RedHat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE (SUSE Enterprise Linux Server) and Ubuntu.
So, it is essential to realize about the various Linux distributions,
[this](https://www.linux.org/threads/selecting-a-linux-distribution.4117/)
article helps you take that choice.

## Getting around in Linux directories.

Now it is time to start learning about the basics of Linux Filesystem
and answer questions like:

1.  How can you navigate between different files?

2.  How to identify a file from a directory?

3.  And understand the different directories that exist?

Hopefully,
[this](https://www.linux.org/threads/getting-around-in-linux-directories.4120/)
article should help answer the above questions.

## Installing a new software (Debian, Redhat)

Let's now learn how new software installation is done in Linux Operating
system, you can go through
[this](https://www.linux.org/threads/installing-new-software-debian-red-hat-slackware.4119/)
article to understand the basics of how new programs are installed on
Debian and Red Hat Linux operating systems. This article should help you
get started with the process to install new software.

## Root Vs System User

Understand the different users in Linux operating system. And when
should you work as root and when should you work as a normal user? Learn
about how users can be added and more.
[This](https://www.linux.org/threads/when-to-work-as-root-when-to-work-as-a-system-user.4136/)
article should help you answer the above questions.

## Linux File System & File Permission

Now since you recognize the different users and groups in Linux
operating system. Its time to understand how you can change ownership
and file permissions on different files and directories in Linux
operating system. These articles introduce commands like
[Chown](https://www.linux.org/threads/file-permisions-chown.4125/) and
[chmod](https://www.linux.org/threads/file-permissions-chmod.4124/) to
change ownership and permissions respectively.

## Commands for System Administration

Introduce yourself to the frequently used commands by the system
administrators to keep an eye on what's going on with their Linux
systems.
[This](https://www.linux.org/threads/commands-for-system-administration.4126/)
article introduces you to the basic commands like last,df,free,du,ps
etc.

You can also refer to the other articles of  \"[Linux Beginner
Tutorials](https://www.linux.org/forums/linux-beginner-tutorials.123/)\" as a good first step towards understanding
Linux Operating System.
