# New to linux resources for SQL users

This article is intended to provide resources to SQL Server users that are new to the Linux environment. 

## What is Linux?

The [What is Linux](https://www.linux.org/threads/what-is-linux.4106/) tutorial introduces you to the Linux environment. Learn about the kernel, and where Linux is today. 


## Linux directories

The [getting around Linux directories](https://www.linux.org/threads/getting-around-in-linux-directories.4120/) introduces you to the linux file system, how to navigate the file path, and how it differs from Windows. 

Learn how to move between folders, list the files in a directory, and access the bin directory. 

## Choosing access strategy 

The [when to work as root](https://www.linux.org/threads/when-to-work-as-root-when-to-work-as-a-system-user.4136/) tutorial introduces users to the linux version of a system administrator, and best practices for managing admin access. 

## File systems and permissions

The [file systems and permissions](https://www.linux.org/threads/linux-file-systems.4123/) tutorial teaches users about how to manage permissions for system files. 

## Admin commands

The [admin commands](https://www.linux.org/threads/commands-for-system-administration.4126/) tutorial introduces users to available commands for the administrator. 

## Next steps
