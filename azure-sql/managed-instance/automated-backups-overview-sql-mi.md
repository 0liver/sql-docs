## Backups and SQL Managed Instance 

This section highlights specific differences when configuring backups for Azure SQL Managed Instance. 

**Backup storage redundancy**

Azure SQL Database supports **locally-redundant (LRS)**, **zone-redundant (ZRS)**, **geo-redundant (GRS)**, and **geo-zone-redundant (GZRS)** storage blobs for automated backups.  To learn more about storage redundancy, see [Data redundancy](/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy). 

**Short-term retention**

If you delete a managed instance, all databases on that managed instance are also deleted and cannot be recovered. You cannot restore a deleted managed instance. But if you had configured long-term retention (LTR) for a managed instance, long-term retention backups are not deleted, and can be used to restore databases to a different managed instance in the same subscription, to a point in time when a long-term retention backup was taken.

**Long-term retention** 

It is possible to set the point-in-time restore (PITR) backup retention rate once a database has been deleted in the 0-35 day range. 

LTR backup storage redundancy in Azure SQL Managed Instance is inherited from the backup storage redundancy used by STR at the time the LTR policy is defined and cannot be changed subsequently, even if the STR backup storage redundancy is changed in the future. 

**Backup storage costs**

For managed instances, a backup storage amount equal to 100 percent of the maximum instance storage size, is provided at no extra charge. 

The total billable backup storage size is aggregated at the instance level and is calculated as follows:

`Total billable backup storage size = (total size of full backups + total size of differential backups + total size of log backups) â€“ maximum instance data storage`
