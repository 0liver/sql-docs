<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace SQL Managed Instance with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace sql-database with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_01
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. All headings are required unless otherwise noted.
The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.

At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:

1. The primary monitoring article (based on the template monitor-service-template.md)
   - Title: "Monitor SQL Managed Instance"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-sql-database.md"

2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on this template).
   - Title: "SQL Managed Instance monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-sql-database-reference.md".

# Azure SQL Managed Instance monitoring data reference

<!-- Intro. Required. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/../azure-sql/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Azure SQL Managed Instance](monitoring-sql-managed-instance-azure-monitor.md) for details on the data you can collect for SQL Managed Instance and how to use it.

<!-- ## Metrics. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/../azure-sql/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]
<!-- Repeat the following section for each resource type/namespace in your service. -->
### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances resource type.
<!-- For each ### section:
1. Replace the <ResourceType/namespace> placeholder in the heading and introductory sentence. Example: ### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices
2. Find the metrics for the resource type at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/metrics-index#supported-metrics-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems.
3. Either link to the listed metrics page(s), OR #include the metrics table(s), starting with the tableheader #include.
4. Add any further information after each metrics table #include or link.
Example link to metrics page: - [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics)
Example #include. Start with the metrics tableheader: -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/../azure-sql/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]
<!-- Add the table. Select the link in the metrics index, and on the metric page, select Edit to see the #include link that pulls in the metrics table. Use that link to add the #include. For example: -->
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances](~/../azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/microsoft-sql-managedinstances-metrics-include.md)]

<!-- ## Metric dimensions. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro](~/../azure-sql/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro.md)]
<!-- Use one of the following includes, depending on whether you have metrics with dimensions.-->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-no-metrics-dimensions](~/../azure-sql/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-no-metrics-dimensions.md)]

<!-- ## Resource logs. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs](~/../azure-sql/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs.md)]

<!-- Add at least one resource provider/resource type here. Repeat this section for each resource type/namespace in your service. Example: ### Supported resource logs for Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices -->
### Supported resource logs for Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances
<!-- For each ### section, follow the same instructions as for the Metrics section, except find the resource logs for your service in the Log Categories column at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/logs-index#supported-log-categories-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems.
Link to or include the logs table. Example link:
- [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-logs) -->
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances](~/../azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/microsoft-sql-managedinstances-logs-include.md)]

### Supported resource logs for Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances/databases
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances/databases](~/../azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/microsoft-sql-managedinstances-databases-logs-include.md)]

<!-- ## Azure Monitor Logs tables. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables](~/../azure-sql/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables.md)]

|Table | Notes |
|-------|-----|
| [AzureActivity columns](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azureactivity) | Entries from the Azure Activity log that provides insight into any subscription-level or management group level events that have occurred in Azure. |
| [AzureDiagnostics columns](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) | Azure Diagnostics reveals diagnostic data of specific resources and features for numerous Azure products including Azure SQL databases, elastic pools, and managed instances. For more information, see [Diagnostics metrics](../database/metrics-diagnostic-telemetry-logging-streaming-export-configure.md?tabs=azure-portal#basic-metrics).|
| [AzureMetrics columns](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azuremetrics) | Metric data emitted by Azure services that measure their health and performance. Activity from Azure products including Azure SQL databases, elastic pools, and managed instances.|

<!-- Find the table(s) for your service at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-resourcetype. These files are auto generated from the REST API. Also refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics#azure-diagnostics-mode to see whether your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table in Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics. 
Link to the service-specific tables. If your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table, list the fields you use and what they're for. If your service uses both tables, list both types of information. Add any further information after each table link, such as descriptions and usage, or information not found in the tables. -->

<!-- ## Activity log. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-activity-log](~/../azure-sql/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-activity-log.md)]
<!-- Refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations and link to the possible operations for your service, using the format - [<Namespace> resource provider operations](/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#<namespace>). -->
- [Microsoft.Sql resource provider operations](/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftsql)

<!-- ## Other schemas. Optional section. Please keep heading in this order. If your service uses other schemas, add the following include and information. 
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-other-schemas](~/../azure-sql/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-other-schemas.md)]
List other schemas and their usage here. These can be resource logs, alerts, event hub formats, etc. depending on what you think is important. You can put JSON messages, API responses not listed in the REST API docs, and other similar types of info here.  -->
