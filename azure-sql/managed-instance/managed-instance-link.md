# Overview of Managed Instance link (limited public preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

The new link feature in SQL Managedâ€¯Instance connects your SQL Servers hosted anywhere to Azure SQL Managed Instance, providing unprecedented hybrid flexibility and database mobility. With an approach that uses near real-time data replication to the cloud, you can offload workloads to read-only secondaries on Azure to take advantage of cloud-only features, performance, and scale. In case of a disaster recovery, you can continue runninng your on-premises workload on Managed Instance in Azure. In addition, you can also choose to migrate one or more applications from SQL Server to Managed Instance at the same time, at your own pace, and with minimum downtime. 

The link feature is in limited public preview with support for SQL Server 2019 Enterprise Edition and SQL Server 2022 CTP1 at this time. All editions starting from SQL Server 2016 and beyond are planned to be supported in the near future. [Sign up now](https://aka.ms/mi-link-signup) to participate in the limited public preview.
