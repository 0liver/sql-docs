# Prepare your environment for a link with WSFC - Azure SQL Managed Instance
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

This article teaches you how to enable Always On with Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) on your SQL Server as an additional step to [prepare your environment](managed-instance-link-preparation.md) for Managed Instance link.

Configuration of a single-node (local) Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) is the minimum mandatory requirement for SQL Server 2016 only. No multiple node WSFC configuration is required for the link, however it's optional. This step is not required for SQL Servers 2019-2022, and it's optional.

## Install WSFC module on Windows Server

- Run the following PowerShell command as Administrator on Windows Server hosting the SQL Server to install Windows Server Failover Cluster module.

```powershell
-- Run as Administrator in PowerShell on Windows Server OS hosting the SQL Server
Install-WindowsFeature -Name Failover-Clustering â€“IncludeManagementTools
```

- Alternatively, you can also use Server Manager to install WSFC module using the graphical user interface.

## Configure single-node cluster using Failover Cluster Manager

On the Windows Server hosting the SQL Server, configure a single node cluster using graphical user interface following these steps:

1. Find out your Windows Server name by executing `hostname` command from the command prompt.
1 Record the output of this command, or keep this window open as you will use this name in one of the next steps.

1. Open Failover Cluster Manager by pressing Windows key + R on the keyboard, type '%windir%\system32\Cluadmin.msc', and click OK

- Alternatively, Failover Cluster Manager can be accessed by opening Server Manager, selecting Tools in the upper right corner, and then selecting Failover Cluster Manager. 

1. In Windows Cluster manager, click on "Create Cluster" option.

1. Click Next.
1. Enter your Windows Server name (type, or copy-paste the output from the earlier executed `hostname` command)
1. Click on Add.

1. Enter the cluster name, for example `WSFCluser`

1. Click Next, and repeat clicking Next all the way through until the cluster creation is started.
1. Conclude by clicking on Finish.

## Verification

To verify that single-node WSFC cluster has been created, follow these steps:

1. In Failover Cluster Manager, click on the cluster name on the left hand side.
1. Click on Nodes.

![Managed Instance link - Validate WSFC](./media/managed-instance-link-preparation-wsfc/mi-link-cluster-validate.png)

You should be able to see the local machine single node added to this cluster which confirms the configuration has been completed.

Next, verify that Always On option can be enabled on SQL Server by following these steps:

1. Open SQL Server Configuration Manager
1. Double-click on SQL Server
1. Click on AlwaysOn High Availability tab

![Managed Instance link - Validate Always On in SQL Server Configuration Manager](./media/managed-instance-link-preparation-wsfc/mi-link-alwayson-validate.png)

You should be able to check on the option to Enable AlwaysOn Availability Groups which confirms the configuration has been completed.

## Grant Permissions in SQL Server to work with WSFC

Next, grant permission in SQL Server to `NT Authority \ System` system account to create Availability Groups using WSFC. Execute the following T-SQL script on your SQL Server:

1. Login to your SQL Server, using a client such is SSMS
2. Execute the following T-SQL script

```sql
-- Run on SQL Server
-- Grant permissions to NT Authority \ System to create AG on this SQL Server
GRANT ALTER ANY AVAILABILITY GROUP TO [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM]
GO
GRANT CONNECT SQL TO [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM]
GO
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM]
GO
```

## Next steps

- Continue environment pereparation for the link by returning to the prepare your environment guide and [enablling Always On](managed-instance-link-preparation.md#enable-availability-groups) on your SQL Server.
- To learn more about configuring multiple-node WSFC (not mandatory for the link, and optional), see [Create a failover cluster](/windows-server/failover-clustering/create-failover-cluster) guide for Windows Server.
