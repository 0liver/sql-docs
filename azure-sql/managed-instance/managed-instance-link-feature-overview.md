# Overview of the Azure SQL Managed Instance link feature (preview)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

This article provides an overview of the SQL Managed Instance link feature, which enables near real-time data replication from SQL Server to your Azure SQL Managed Instance deployment. The link provides hybrid flexibility and database mobility as it unlocks a number of scenarios, such as scaling read-only workloads, offloading analytics and reporting to Azure, and migrating to the cloud. And, with SQL Server 2022, the SQL Managed Instance link feature enables disaster recovery. 

If you have product improvement suggestions or comments, or you want to report issues, contact our team through [SQL Managed Instance link user feedback](https://aka.ms/mi-link-feedback).

## Overview

The SQL Managed Instance link feature uses distributed availability groups to extend your SQL Server on-premises availability group hosted anywhere to Azure SQL Managed Instance in a safe and secure manner, replicating data in near real-time. 

The link supports single node SQL Server instances without existing availability groups, and also multiple-node SQL Server instances with existing availability groups. Through the link, you can use the latest benefits of Azure without migrating your entire SQL Server data estate to the cloud.

The link feature currently offers the following functionality:

- **One-way replication (SQL Server versions 2017 to 2019)**: Use the link feature to replicate data one way from SQL Server to your Azure SQL Managed Instance deployment. Although you can manually fail over to your managed instance in the event of a disaster, doing so breaks the link, and failing back is not supported. 
- **Disaster recovery (SQL Server 2022)**: Use the link feature to replicate data from SQL Server 2022 to your Azure SQL Managed Instance deployment, manually fail over to your managed instance in the event of a disaster, and fail back to SQL Server after the disaster is mitigated.  

    This feature is currently in limited public preview. [You must sign up for limited public preview](https://aka.ms/mi-link-dr-preview-signup) so that the product group can configure your environment for the preview. 

You can keep running the link for as long as you need it, for months and even years at a time. And for your modernization journey, if or when you're ready to migrate to Azure, the link enables a considerably improved migration experience. It offers minimal downtime, compared to all other options available today, and it provides a true online migration to your SQL Managed Instance deployment.

## Prerequisites

To use the link feature, you'll need a supported Enterprise, Standard, or Developer edition of SQL Server running on Windows Server. 

The following table lists the functionality of the link feature and the supported SQL Server versions:

SQL Server versions 2008 to 2014 aren't supported, because the link feature relies on Always On availability group technology, which was introduced in SQL Server 2016. 

In addition to the supported SQL Server version, you'll need:

- Network connectivity between your SQL Server instance and your managed instance. If your SQL Server instance is running on-premises, use a VPN link or Azure ExpressRoute. If your SQL Server is running on an Azure virtual machine (VM), either deploy your VM to the same virtual network as your managed instance, or use virtual network peering to connect two separate subnets. 
- An Azure SQL Managed Instance deployment, provisioned to any service tier.

You'll also need the following tooling:

| Tool&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | Notes  | 
| --- | --- |
| [SSMS 19.0](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) or later | SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is the easiest way to use the SQL Managed Instance link. It provides graphical wizards for automated link setup for SQL Server versions 2016, 2019, and 2022. The ability to use SSMS to fail back from your managed instance to SQL Server 2022 is available only in limited public preview. [Sign up for limited public preview](https://aka.ms/mi-link-dr-preview-signup). |
| [Az.SQL 3.9.0](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Sql) or later | PowerShell module is required for manual configuration steps. |

> [!NOTE]
> The SQL Managed Instance link feature is available in all public Azure regions and national or government clouds.

## How the link feature works

The underlying technology behind the link feature for SQL Managed Instance creates a distributed availability group between SQL Server and your Azure SQL Managed Instance deployment. The solution supports single-node systems without existing availability groups, or multiple node systems with existing availability groups.  

:::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-feature-overview/mi-link-ag-dag.png" alt-text="Diagram showing how the link feature for SQL Managed Instance works.":::

Secure connectivity, such as a VPN or Azure ExpressRoute is used between an on-premises network and Azure. If SQL Server is hosted on an Azure VM, the internal Azure backbone can be used between the VM and managed instance â€“ such as, for example, virtual network peering. The trust between the two systems is established using certificate-based authentication, in which SQL Server and SQL Managed Instance exchange their public keys.

There could exist up to 100 links from the same, or various SQL Server sources to a single SQL Managed Instance. This limit is governed by the number of databases that could be hosted on a managed instance at this time. Likewise, a single SQL Server can establish multiple parallel database replication links with several managed instances in different Azure regions in a 1 to 1 relationship between a database and a managed instance. 

## Supported scenarios

Databases that are replicated through the link feature from a SQL Server instance to a SQL Managed Instance deployment can be used with several scenarios, such as: 

- Using Azure services without migrating to the cloud 
- Offloading read-only workloads to Azure 
- Migrating to Azure
- Disaster recovery with SQL Server 2022 (currently in limited public preview)

:::image type="content" source="./media/managed-instance-link-feature-overview/mi-link-main-scenario.png" alt-text="Diagram that illustrates the main SQL Managed Instance link scenario.":::

### Use Azure services 

Use the link feature to take advantage of Azure services by using SQL Server data without migrating it to the cloud. Examples include reporting, analytics, backups, machine learning, and other jobs that send data to Azure. 

### Offload workloads to Azure 

You can also use the link feature to offload workloads to Azure. For example, an application could use SQL Server for read/write workloads, while it offloads read-only workloads to your SQL Managed Instance deployment in any Azure region worldwide. After the link is established, the primary database on SQL Server is read/write accessible, while replicated data to your managed instance in Azure is read-only accessible. This allows for various scenarios where replicated databases on your managed instance can be used for read scale-out and offloading read-only workloads to Azure. Your SQL Managed Instance deployment, in parallel, can also host independent read/write databases. This allows for copying the replicated database to another read/write database on the same managed instance for further data processing.

The link is database scoped (one link per one database), allowing for consolidation and deconsolidation of workloads in Azure. For example, you can replicate databases from multiple SQL Server instances to a single SQL Managed Instance deployment in Azure (consolidation), or you can replicate databases from a single SQL Server instance to multiple managed instances via a 1-to-1 relationship between a database and a managed instance, to any Azure region worldwide (deconsolidation). The latter option provides you with an efficient way to quickly bring your workloads closer to your customers in any region worldwide, which you can use as read-only replicas.

### Migrate to Azure 

The link feature also facilitates migrating from SQL Server to your SQL Managed Instance deployment, enabling: 

- The most performant, minimal downtime migration, compared to all other solutions available today.
- True online migration to a SQL Managed Instance in any service tier. 

Because the link feature enables minimal downtime migration, you can migrate to your managed instance while maintaining your primary workload online. Although online migration was possible to achieve previously with other solutions during migrations to the General Purpose service tier, the link feature now also allows for true online migrations to the Business Critical service tier as well. 

### Automated backups 

After your databases are replicated to your managed instance, they're automatically backed up to your Azure Blob Storage account with Azure Backup. You can reduce your on-premises management and operation costs while enjoying the reliability of Azure Backup for your replicated databases. You can then perform a [point-in-time restore](point-in-time-restore.md) of your replicated database to any SQL Managed Instance deployment in the same region, as with any other [automated backup](automated-backups-overview.md). 

### Disaster recovery 

If you're running SQL Server 2022, you can use the SQL Managed Instance link for disaster recovery, where, in the event of a disaster, you can manually fail over your workload to your Azure SQL Managed Instance deployment. After the disaster is mitigated, you can fail back to your SQL Server 2022 instance. 

This feature is currently in limited public preview. [You must sign up for limited public preview](https://aka.ms/mi-link-dr-preview-signup) so that the product group can configure your environment for the preview.

## Use the link feature

To prepare your SQL Server environment for use with the link feature for SQL Managed Instance, see [Prepare your environment for a link - Azure SQL Managed Instance](managed-instance-link-preparation.md).

After you've met the prerequisites for using the link feature, you can either create the link by using the automated wizard in SSMS or you can set up the link manually by using scripts: 

* [Replicate a database by using the link feature in SSMS](managed-instance-link-use-ssms-to-replicate-database.md), or alternatively
* [Replicate a database with the link feature via T-SQL and PowerShell scripts](managed-instance-link-use-scripts-to-replicate-database.md)

After you've created the link, to ensure that you're following the best practices for maintaining the link, see [Best practices for the link feature in Azure SQL Managed Instance](managed-instance-link-best-practices.md).

When you're ready to migrate a database to Azure with minimal downtime, you can do so by using an automated wizard in SSMS or manually by using scripts:

* [Fail over a database by using the link in SSMS](managed-instance-link-use-ssms-to-failover-database.md)
* [Fail over a database by using T-SQL and PowerShell scripts](managed-instance-link-use-scripts-to-failover-database.md)


## Limitations

Consider the following limitations when you're using the link. 

* Version supportability limitations include: 

  - Client Windows versions 10 and 11 can't be used to host your SQL Server instance, because it's not possible to enable the Always On availability group feature that's required for the link. The SQL Server instance must be hosted on Windows Server 2012 or later.

  - SQL Server versions 2008 to 2014 aren't supported by the link feature, because the SQL engine of these releases doesn't have built-in support for the distributed availability groups that are required for the link. Upgrade to a later version of SQL Server to use the link.


* Data replication limitations include: 

  - Only user databases can be replicated. Replication of system databases isn't supported.

  - The solution doesn't replicate server-level objects, agent jobs, or user logins from SQL Server to SQL Managed Instance.

  - For SQL Server versions 2016 to 2019, replication of user databases from SQL Server instances to SQL Managed Instance deployments is one way. User databases from SQL Managed Instance deployments can't be replicated back to SQL Server instances. Two-way replication with failback to a SQL Server instance is available only for SQL Server 2022. 


* Configuration limitations include: 

  - If there are multiple SQL Server instances on a server, it's possible to configure a link with each instance, but each instance must be configured to use a separate database-mirroring endpoint, with a dedicated port per instance. Only the default instance should use port 5022 for the database-mirroring endpoint. 

  - Only one database can be placed into a single availability group per one SQL Managed Instance link.

  - A SQL Managed Instance link can replicate a database of any size if it fits into the chosen storage size of the target SQL Managed Instance deployment.

  - SQL Managed Instance link authentication between a SQL Server instance and a SQL Managed Instance deployment is certificate-based, available only through an exchange of certificates. Using Windows authentication to establish the link between the SQL Server instance and the managed instance isn't supported.

  - A private endpoint (VPN/virtual network) is supported to establish a link with a SQL Managed Instance deployment. A public endpoint can't be used to establish the link with the managed instance.


* Feature limitations include: 

  - [Auto failover group](auto-failover-group-sql-mi.md) replication to secondary SQL Managed Instance deployments can't be used in parallel while you're operating the SQL Managed Instance link with the SQL Server instance.

  - If you're using Change Data Capture (CDC), log shipping, or a service broker with databases that are replicated on the SQL Server instance, when the database is migrated to a SQL Managed Instance deployment, during a failover to Azure, clients will need to connect using the instance name of the current global primary replica. These settings should be manually reconfigured. 

  - If you're using transactional replication with a database on a SQL Server instance in a migration scenario, during failover to Azure, the transactional replication on the SQL Managed Instance deployment will fail and should be manually reconfigured. 

  - If distributed transactions are used with a database that's replicated from the SQL Server instance and, in a migration scenario, on the cutover to the cloud, Distributed Transaction Coordinator capabilities won't be transferred. It's not possible for the migrated database to get involved in distributed transactions with the SQL Server instance, because the SQL Managed Instance deployment doesn't support distributed transactions with SQL Server at this time. For reference, SQL Managed Instance today supports distributed transactions only between other managed instances. For more information, see [Distributed transactions across cloud databases](../database/elastic-transactions-overview.md#transactions-for-sql-managed-instance).

  - The link can't be established between the SQL Server instance and the SQL Managed Instance deployment if the functionality that's used on the SQL Server instance isn't supported on the managed instance. For example: 

    - File tables and file streams aren't supported for replication, because SQL Managed Instance doesn't support them.

    - Replicating databases by using In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton) isn't supported on the SQL Managed Instance General Purpose service tier. In-Memory OLTP is supported only on the SQL Managed Instance Business Critical service tier.
