# Assessment rules for SQL Server to SQL Database migration
[!INCLUDE[appliesto--sqldb](../../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

Migration tools validate your source SQL Server instance by running a number of assessment rules to identify issues that must be addressed before migrating your SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database. 

This article provides a list of the rules used to assess the feasibility of migrating your SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database. 

## Agentjobs

**Title: SQL Server Agent jobs are not available in Azure SQL Database**   
Rule ID:AgentJobs (Warning)  

**Description**   
SQL Server Agent is a Microsoft Windows service that executes scheduled administrative tasks, which are called jobs in SQL Server. SQL Server Agent jobs are not available in Azure SQL Database. 

**Recommendation** 
Use elastic jobs (preview), which are the replacement for SQL Server Agent jobs in Azure SQL Database. Elastic Database jobs for Azure SQL Database allows you to reliably execute T-SQL scripts that span multiple databases while automatically retrying and providing eventual completion guarantees. Alternatively consider migrating to  Azure SQL Managed Instance or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.

More information: [Getting started with Elastic Database jobs (Preview) ](../../database/elastic-jobs-overview.md)



## BulkInsert

**Title: BULK INSERT with non Azure blob data source is not supported in Azure SQL Database.**   
Rule ID: BulkInsert (Issue)

**Description**   
Azure SQL Database cannot access file shares or Windows folders. See the "Impacted Objects" section for the specific uses of BULK INSERT statements that do not reference an Azure blob. Objects with 'BULK INSERT' where the source is not Azure blob storage will not work after migrating to Azure SQL Database. 

**Recommendation**   
You will need to convert BULK INSERT statements that use local files or file shares to use files from Azure blob storage instead, when migrating to Azure SQL Database.

## ComputeClause

**Title: COMPUTE clause is discontinued and has been removed.**   
Rule ID: ComputeClause (Issue)

**Description**   
The COMPUTE clause generates totals that appear as additional summary columns at the end of the result set. However, this clause is no longer supported in Azure SQL Database. 

**Recommendation**   

The T-SQL module needs to be re-written using the ROLLUP operator instead. The code below demonstrates how COMPUTE can be replaced with ROLLUP : 

```sql 
USE AdventureWorks 
GO;  

SELECT SalesOrderID, UnitPrice, UnitPriceDiscount 
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail 
ORDER BY SalesOrderID COMPUTE SUM(UnitPrice), SUM(UnitPriceDiscount) BY SalesOrderID GO; 

SELECT SalesOrderID, UnitPrice, UnitPriceDiscount,SUM(UnitPrice) as UnitPrice , 
SUM(UnitPriceDiscount) as UnitPriceDiscount 
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail 
GROUP BY SalesOrderID, UnitPrice, UnitPriceDiscount WITH ROLLUP; 
```

## CDC

**Title: Change Data Capture (CDC) is not supported in Azure SQL Database**   
Rule ID: CDC (Issue)

**Description**   
Change data capture is designed to capture insert, update, and delete activity applied to SQL Server tables, and to make the details of the changes available in an easily consumed relational format. Change Data Capture (CDC) is not supported in Azure SQL Database

**Recommendation**   
Change Data Capture (CDC) is not supported in Azure SQL Database. Evaluate if Change Tracking can be used instead or consider migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance.

More information: [Enable Azure SQL change tracking](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2976.azure-sql-how-to-enable-change-tracking.aspx)

## ClrAssemblies

**Title: SQL CLR assemblies are not supported in Azure SQL Database**   
Rule ID: ClrAssemblies (Issue)

**Description**   
For security reasons, Azure SQL Database does not support SQL CLR assemblies.   

**Recommendation**   
Currently, there is no way to achieve this in Azure SQL Database. The recommended alternative solutions will require application code and database changes to use only assemblies supported by Azure SQL Database or consider migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.

**Recommendation**   
Azure SQL Database does not support cross-database queries. The following actions are recommended: Consider migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance, Consider migrating the dependent database(s) to Azure SQL Database and use 'Elastic Database Query' (preview) functionality to query across Azure SQL databases, Consider moving the dependent datasets from other databases into the database that is being migrated.

## DatabaseCompatibility

**Title: Azure SQL Database doesn't support compatibility levels below 100.**   
Rule ID: DatabaseCompatibility (Issue)

**Description**   
Database Compatibility Level is a valuable tool to assist in database modernization, by allowing the SQL Server Database Engine to be upgraded, while keeping connecting applications functional status by maintaining the same pre-upgrade Database Compatibility Level. Azure SQL Database doesnâ€™t support compatibility levels below 100. 

**Recommendation**   
Consider upgrading the database compatibility or migrating to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.

## DatabaseMail

**Title: Database Mail is not supported in Azure SQL Database.**   
Rule ID: DatabaseMail (Warning)  

**Description**

Use ANSI join syntax.

More information: [Discontinued Database Engine functionality in SQL Server](/previous-versions/sql/2014/database-engine/discontinued-database-engine-functionality-in-sql-server-2016?view=sql-server-2014#Denali)

## NextColumn 

**Title: Tables and Columns named NEXT will lead to an error In Azure SQL Database.**   
Rule ID: NextColumn (Issue)

**Description**   
Tables or columns named NEXT were detected. Sequences, introduced in Microsoft SQL Server, use the ANSI standard NEXT VALUE FOR function. If a table or a column is named NEXT and the column is aliased as VALUE, and if the ANSI standard AS is omitted, the resulting statement can cause an error.  

**Recommendation**   
Rewrite statements to include the ANSI standard AS keyword when aliasing a table or column. For example, when a column is named NEXT and that column is aliased as VALUE, the query SELECT NEXT VALUE FROM TABLE will cause an error and should be rewritten as SELECT NEXT AS VALUE FROM TABLE. Similarly, when a table is named NEXT and that table is aliased as VALUE, the query SELECT Col1 FROM NEXT VALUE will cause an error and should be rewritten as SELECT Col1 FROM NEXT AS VALUE.

## RAISERROR

**Title: Legacy style RAISERROR calls should be replaced with modern equivalents.**   
Rule ID: RAISERROR (Issue)

**Description**   
RAISERROR calls like the below example are termed as legacy-style because they do not include the commas and the parenthesis.RAISERROR 50001 'this is a test'. This method of calling RAISERROR is discontinued and removed in Azure SQL Database. 

**Recommendation**   
Rewrite the statement using the current RAISERROR syntax, or evaluate if the modern approach of TRY...CATCH...THROW is feasible.

More information: [Discontinued Database Engine functionality in SQL Server](/previous-versions/sql/2014/database-engine/discontinued-database-engine-functionality-in-sql-server-2016?view=sql-server-2014#Denali)

## ServerAudits 

**Title: Use Azure SQL Database audit features to replace Server Audits**   
Rule ID: ServerAudits (Warning)  

**Description**   
Auditing an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine or an individual database involves tracking and logging events that occur on the Database Engine. SQL Server audit lets you create server audits, which can contain server audit specifications for server level events, and database audit specifications for database level events. Server audits are not supported in Azure SQL Database, use database audits as a replacement.

**Recommendation**   
Consider Azure SQL Database audit features to replace Server Audits.  Azure SQL supports audit and the features are richer than SQL Server. Azure SQL can audit various database actions and events, including: Access to data, Schema changes (DDL), Data changes (DML), Accounts, roles, and permissions (DCL, Security exceptions. SQL Database Auditing increases an organization's ability to gain deep insight into events and changes that occur within their SQL database, including updates and queries against the data.    

More information: [Auditing for Azure SQL Database ](../../database/auditing-overview.md)

## ServerCredentials

**Title: Server scoped credential is not supported in Azure SQL Database**   
Rule ID: ServerCredentials (Warning)  

**Description**   
A credential is a record that contains the authentication information (credentials) required to connect to a resource outside SQL Server. Azure SQL Database supports database credentials, but not the ones created at the SQL Server scope.   

**Recommendation**   
Azure SQL Database supports database scoped credentials. Convert server scoped credentials to database scoped credentials.

More information: [Creating database scoped credential](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-database-scoped-credential-transact-sql)

## ServiceBroker

**Title: Service Broker feature is not supported in Azure SQL Database**   
Rule ID: ServiceBroker (Issue)

**Description**   
SQL Server Service Broker provides native support for messaging and queuing applications in the SQL Server Database Engine. Service Broker feature is not supported in Azure SQL Database.

**Recommendation**   
Service Broker feature is not supported in Azure SQL Database. Consider migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance that supports service broker within the same instance.  

## ServerScopedTriggers

**Title: Server-scoped trigger is not supported in Azure SQL Database**   
Rule ID: ServerScopedTriggers (Warning)  

**Description**   
A trigger is a special kind of stored procedure that executes in response to certain action on a table like insertion, deletion or updating of data. Server-scoped triggers are not supported in Azure SQL Database. Azure does not support the following options for triggers:FOR LOGON, ENCRYPTION, WITH APPEND, NOT FOR REPLICATION, EXTERNAL NAME option (there is no external method support), ALL SERVER Option (DDL Trigger), Trigger on a LOGON event (Logon Trigger), Azure does not support CLR-triggers.

**Recommendation**   
Consider Azure SQL Managed Instance that supports server scoped triggers. Alternatively, if you already have a VM running in Azure, you can implement the trigger logic to be run using the machine's task scheduler.
