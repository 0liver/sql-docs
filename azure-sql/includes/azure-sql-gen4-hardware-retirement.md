> Gen4 hardware is being retired and is not available for new deployments. Existing customers using Gen4 should migrate before January 2023. For more information on mapping Gen4 hardware to modern hardware, see [Blog post on Gen4 retirement](TBD). Existing Gen4 instances will be migrated automatically to equivalent Standard-series hardware in January 2023.
