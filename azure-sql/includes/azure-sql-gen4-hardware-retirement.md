> [!IMPORTANT]
> Gen4 hardware is being retired and is not available for new deployments, as [announced](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/gen-4-hardware-on-azure-sql-database-approaching-end-of-life-in-2020) on December 18 2019. Customers using Gen4 should migrate to currently available hardware, such as standard-series (Gen5), before January 2023. 
>
> For more information on Gen4 hardware retirement and migration to current hardware, see [Blog post on Gen4 retirement](TBD). Existing Gen4 databases, elastic pools, and managed instances will be migrated automatically to equivalent standard-series (Gen5) hardware.
>
> Downtime caused by automatic migration will be minimal and similar to downtime during scaling operations within selected service tier. To avoid unplanned interruptions to workloads, consider migrating proactively at the time of your choice before January 2023.
