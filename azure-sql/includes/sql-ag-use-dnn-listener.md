> [!NOTE]
> Customers who are using SQL Server 2019 CU8 and later on Windows 2016 and later can replace the traditional virtual network name (VNN) listener and Azure Load Balancer with a [distributed network name (DNN) listener](../virtual-machines/windows/availability-group-distributed-network-name-dnn-listener-configure.md). If you're in that group, skip the rest of the steps in this article that create the listener and load balancer.
