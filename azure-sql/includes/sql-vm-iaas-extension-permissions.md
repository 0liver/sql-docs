> [!NOTE]
> SQL Server VMs deployed via the Azure marketplace after October 2022 date have the least privileged model enabled by default. 
> SQL Server VMs registered with the extension after March 2023 all use the same configuration and least privileged security model since [management modes](../virtual-machines/windows/sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#management-modes) were removed.
