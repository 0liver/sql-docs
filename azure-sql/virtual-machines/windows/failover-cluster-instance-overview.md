# Failover cluster instances with SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlvm](../../includes/appliesto-sqlvm.md)]

This article introduces feature differences when you're working with failover cluster instances (FCI) for SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). 

## Overview

SQL Server on Azure VMs uses Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) functionality to provide local high availability through redundancy at the server-instance level: a failover cluster instance. An FCI is a single instance of SQL Server that's installed across WSFC (or simply the cluster) nodes and, possibly, across multiple subnets. On the network, an FCI appears to be an instance of SQL Server running on a single computer. But the FCI provides failover from one WSFC node to another if the current node becomes unavailable.

The rest of the article focuses on the differences for failover cluster instances when they're used with SQL Server on Azure VMs. To learn more about the failover clustering technology, see: 

- [Windows cluster technologies](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/failover-clustering/failover-clustering-overview)
- [SQL Server failover cluster instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/sql-server/failover-clusters/windows/always-on-failover-cluster-instances-sql-server)

## Quorum

Failover cluster instances with SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines support using a disk witness, a cloud witness, or a file share witness for cluster quorum.

To learn more, see [Quorum best practices with SQL Server VMs in Azure](hadr-cluster-best-practices.md#quorum). 


## Storage

In traditional on-premises clustered environments, a Windows failover cluster uses a storage area network (SAN) that's accessible by both nodes as the shared storage. SQL Server files are hosted on the shared storage, and only the active node can access the files at one time. SQL Server on Azure VMs offers various options as a shared storage solution for a deployment of SQL Server failover cluster instances: 

||[Azure shared disks](../../../virtual-machines/windows/disks-shared.md)|[Premium file shares](../../../storage/files/storage-how-to-create-premium-fileshare.md) |[Storage Spaces Direct (S2D)](/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview)|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Minimum OS version| Windows Server 2019|Windows Server 2012|Windows Server 2016|
|Minimum SQL Server version|SQL Server 2019|SQL Server 2012|SQL Server 2016|
|Supported VM availability |Availability sets with proximity placement groups |Availability sets and availability zones|Availability sets |
|Supports FileStream|No|No|Yes |
|Azure blob cache|No|No|Yes|

The rest of this section lists the benefits and limitations of each storage option available for SQL Server on Azure VMs. 

### Azure shared disks

[Azure shared disks](../../../virtual-machines/windows/disks-shared.md) are a feature of [Azure managed disks](../../../virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview.md). Windows Server Failover Clustering supports using Azure shared disks with a failover cluster instance. 

**Supported OS**: Windows Server 2019   
**Supported SQL version**: SQL Server 2019   

**Benefits**: 
- Useful for applications looking to migrate to Azure while keeping their high-availability and disaster recovery (HADR) architecture as is. 
- Can migrate clustered applications to Azure as is because of SCSI Persistent Reservations (SCSI PR) support. 
- Supports shared Azure Premium SSD for all versions of SQL Server and shared Azure Ultra Disk Storage for SQL Server 2019. 
- Can use a single shared disk or stripe multiple shared disks to create a shared storage pool. 


**Limitations**: 
- Available only for SQL Server 2019 and Windows Server 2019 while in preview. 
- Virtual machines must be placed in the same availability set and proximity placement group.
- Availability zones are not supported.
- Premium SSD disk caching is not supported.
 
To get started, see [SQL Server failover cluster instance with Azure shared disks](failover-cluster-instance-azure-shared-disks-manually-configure.md). 

### Storage Spaces Direct

[Storage Spaces Direct](/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview) is a Windows Server feature that is supported with failover clustering on Azure Virtual Machines. It provides a software-based virtual SAN.

**Supported OS**: Windows Server 2016 and later   
**Supported SQL version**: SQL Server 2016 and later   


**Benefits:** 
- Sufficient network bandwidth enables a robust and highly performant shared storage solution. 
- Supports Azure blob cache, so reads can be served locally from the cache. (Updates are replicated simultaneously to both nodes.) 
- Supports FileStream. 

**Limitations:**
- Available only for Windows Server 2016 and later. 
- Availability zones are not supported.
- Requires the same disk capacity attached to both virtual machines. 
- High network bandwidth is required to achieve high performance because of ongoing disk replication. 
- Requires a larger VM size and double pay for storage, because storage is attached to each VM. 

To get started, see [SQL Server failover cluster instance with Storage Spaces Direct](failover-cluster-instance-azure-shared-disks-manually-configure.md). 

### Premium file share

[Premium file shares](../../../storage/files/storage-how-to-create-premium-fileshare.md) are a feature of [Azure Files](../../../storage/files/index.yml). Premium file shares are SSD backed and have consistently low latency. They're fully supported for use with failover cluster instances for SQL Server 2012 or later on Windows Server 2012 or later. Premium file shares give you greater flexibility, because you can resize and scale a file share without any downtime.

**Supported OS**: Windows Server 2012 and later   
**Supported SQL version**: SQL Server 2012 and later   

**Benefits:** 
- Only shared storage solution for virtual machines spread over multiple availability zones. 
- Fully managed file system with single-digit latencies and burstable I/O performance. 

**Limitations:**
- Available only for Windows Server 2012 and later. 
- FileStream is not supported. 


To get started, see [SQL Server failover cluster instance with Premium file share](failover-cluster-instance-premium-file-share-manually-configure.md). 

### Partner

There are partner clustering solutions with supported storage. 

**Supported OS**: All   
**Supported SQL version**: All   

One example uses SIOS DataKeeper as the storage. For more information, see the blog entry [Failover clustering and SIOS DataKeeper](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/high-availability-for-a-file-share-using-wsfc-ilb-and-3rd-party-software-sios-datakeeper/).

### iSCSI and ExpressRoute

You can also expose an iSCSI target shared block storage via Azure ExpressRoute. 

**Supported OS**: All   
**Supported SQL version**: All   

For example, NetApp Private Storage (NPS) exposes an iSCSI target via ExpressRoute with Equinix to Azure VMs.

For shared storage and data replication solutions from Microsoft partners, contact the vendor for any issues related to accessing data on failover.



## Connectivity

Failover cluster instances with SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines use a [virtual network name (VNN) with Azure Load Balancer](hadr-vnn-azure-load-balancer-configure.md) or a [distributed network name (DNN)](hadr-distributed-network-name-dnn-configure.md) to route traffic to the SQL Server instance, regardless of which node currently owns the clustered resources. 

To learn more, see [Route HADR connections to SQL Server on Azure VMs](hadr-cluster-best-practices.md#route-connections). 

## DNN feature interoperability

Consider feature interoperability when you're using the DNN resource with FCI and the following SQL Server features. 

### Client access   
For ODBC, OLEDB, ADO.NET, JDBC, PHP, and Node.js drivers, users need to explicitly specify the DNN DNS name as the server name in the connection string. 

### Tools   
Users of [SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms), [sqlcmd](sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility), [Azure Data Studio](/sql/azure-data-studio/what-is), and [SQL Server Data Tools](/sql/ssdt/sql-server-data-tools) need to explicitly specify the DNN DNS name as the server name in the connection string. 

### Availability groups and FCI   
You can configure an Always On availability group by using a failover cluster instance as one of the replicas. In this configuration, the mirroring endpoint URL for the FCI replica needs to use the FCI DNN. Likewise, if the FCI is used as a read-only replica, the read-only routing to the FCI replica needs to use the FCI DNN. 

The format for the mirroring endpoint is: `ENDPOINT_URL = 'TCP://<DNN DNS name>:<mirroring endpoint port>'`. 

For example, if your DNN DNS name is `dnnlsnr`, and `5022` is the port of the FCI's mirroring endpoint, the Transact-SQL (T-SQL) code snippet to create the endpoint URL looks like: 

```sql
ENDPOINT_URL = 'TCP://dnnlsnr:5022'
```

Likewise, the format for the read-only routing URL is: `TCP://<DNN DNS name>:<SQL Server instance port>`. 

For example, if your DNN DNS name is `dnnlsnr`, and `1444` is the port used by the read-only target SQL Server FCI, the T-SQL code snippet to create the read-only routing URL looks like: 

```sql
READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL = 'TCP://dnnlsnr:1444'
```

You can omit the port in the URL if it is the default 1433 port. For a named instance, configure a static port for the named instance and specify it in the read-only routing URL.  

### Replication   
Replication has three components: Publisher, Distributor, Subscriber. Any of these components can be a failover cluster instance. Because the FCI VNN is heavily used in replication configuration, both explicitly and implicitly, a network alias that maps the VNN to the DNN might be necessary for replication to work. 

Keep using the VNN name as the FCI instance name within replication, but create a network alias in the following remote situations *before you configure replication*:

| **Replication component (FCI with DNN)** | **Remote component** | **Network alias map** | **Server with network map**| 
|---------|---------|---------|-------- | 
|Publisher | Distributor | Publisher VNN to Publisher DNN| Distributor| 
|Distributor|Subscriber |Distributor VNN to Distributor DNN| Subscriber | 
|Distributor|Publisher | Distributor VNN to Distributor DNN | Publisher| 
|Subscriber| Distributor| Subscriber VNN to Subscriber DNN | Distributor| 

For example, assume you have a Publisher that's configured as an FCI using DNN in a replication topology, and the Distributor is remote. In that case, create a network alias on the Distributor server to map the Publisher VNN to the Publisher DNN: 

:::image type="content" source="media/failover-cluster-instance-overview/alias-in-configuration-manager.png" alt-text="Configure the DNN DNS name as the network alias using SQL Server Configuration Manager." :::

Use the full instance name for a named instance, like the following image example: 

:::image type="content" source="media/failover-cluster-instance-overview/alias-named-instance-configuration-manager.png" alt-text="Use the full instance name when configuring a network alias for a named instance." :::

### Database mirroring   
You can configure database mirroring with an FCI as either database mirroring partner. Configure it by using [Transact-SQL (T-SQL)](/sql/database-engine/database-mirroring/example-setting-up-database-mirroring-using-windows-authentication-transact-sql) rather than the SQL Server Management Studio GUI. Using T-SQL will ensure that the database mirroring endpoint is created using the DNN instead of the VNN. 

For example, if your DNN DNS name is `dnnlsnr`, and the database mirroring endpoint is 7022, the following T-SQL code snippet configures the database mirroring partner: 

```sql
ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks
    SET PARTNER =
    'TCP://dnnlsnr:7022'
GO 
```

For client access, the **Failover Partner** property can handle database mirroring failover, but not FCI failover. 

### MSDTC   
The FCI can participate in distributed transactions coordinated by Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC). Though both clustered MSDTC and local MSDTC are supported with FCI DNN, in Azure, a load balancer is still necessary for clustered MSDTC. The DNN defined in the FCI does not replace the Azure Load Balancer requirement for the clustered MSDTC in Azure. 

### FileStream   
Though FileStream is supported for a database in an FCI, accessing FileStream or FileTable by using File System APIs with DNN is not supported. 

### Linked servers   
Using a linked server with an FCI DNN is supported. Either use the DNN directly to configure a linked server, or use a network alias to map the VNN to the DNN. 


For example, to create a linked server with DNN DNS name `dnnlsnr` for named instance `insta1`, use the following Transact-SQL (T-SQL) command:

```sql
USE [master]   
GO   

EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedserver    
    @server = N'dnnlsnr\inst1',    
    @srvproduct=N'SQL Server' ;   
GO 
```

Alternatively, you can create the linked server using the virtual network name (VNN) instead, but you will then need to define a network alias to map the VNN to the DNN. 

For example, for instance name `insta1`, VNN name `vnnname`, and DNN name `dnnlsnr`, use the following Transact-SQL (T-SQL) command to create a linked server using the VNN:

```sql
USE [master]
GO   

EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedserver   
    @server = N'vnnname\inst1',    
    @srvproduct=N'SQL Server' ;   
GO 

```

Then, create a network alias to map `vnnname\insta1` to `dnnlsnr\insta1`. 


## Limitations

Consider the following limitations for failover cluster instances with SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. 

### Lightweight resource provider   
At this time, SQL Server failover cluster instances on Azure virtual machines are supported only with the [lightweight management mode](sql-vm-resource-provider-register.md#management-modes) of the [SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md). To change from full extension mode to lightweight, delete the **SQL virtual machine** resource for the corresponding VMs and then register them with the SQL VM resource provider in lightweight mode. When you're deleting the **SQL virtual machine** resource by using the Azure portal, clear the check box next to the correct virtual machine. 

The full extension supports features such as automated backup, patching, and advanced portal management. These features will not work for SQL Server VMs after the agent is reinstalled in lightweight management mode.

### MSDTC   
Azure Virtual Machines supports MSDTC on Windows Server 2019 with storage on Clustered Shared Volumes (CSV) and [Azure Standard Load Balancer](../../../load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-overview.md).

On Azure Virtual Machines, MSDTC isn't supported for Windows Server 2016 or earlier because:

- The clustered MSDTC resource can't be configured to use shared storage. On Windows Server 2016, if you create an MSDTC resource, it won't show any shared storage available for use, even if storage is available. This issue has been fixed in Windows Server 2019.
- The basic load balancer doesn't handle RPC ports.
