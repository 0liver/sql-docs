# SQL Maintenance Window (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

The SQL Maintenance Window feature allows for the configuration of predictable maintenance window schedules for [Azure SQL Database](sql-database-paas-overview.md) and [SQL Managed Instance](../managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md). 

> [!Note]
> For more information on maintenance events, see [Plan for Azure maintenance events in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance](planned-maintenance.md).

## Overview

Azure performs planned maintenance updates on Azure SQL Database resources periodically that often include updates to underlying hardware, software including underlying operating system (OS) and the SQL engine. During a maintenance update, Azure SQL Databases are fully available and accessible but some of the maintenance updates require a failover as Azure takes SQL DB instances offline for a short time to apply the maintenance updates (eight seconds in duration on average).  Planned maintenance updates occur once every 35 days on average, which means customer can expect approximately one planned maintenance event per month per Azure SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance, and only during the maintenance window slots selected by the customer.   

The SQL Maintenance Window is intended for business workloads that are sensitive to the potential connectivity interruptions that can result from planned maintenance events during the default window.  

SQL Maintenance Window can be configured using the Azure portal PowerShell, or CLI on creation, or for existing Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instances.

### Gain more predictability with SQL maintenance window

By default, all SQL Azure databases and Managed Instance databases are updated only during 5PM to 8AM local times daily to avoid peak business hours interruptions. Local time is determined by the Azure region that hosts the resource. You can further adjust the maintenance updates to a time suitable to your database by choosing from two additional SQL Maintenance Window slots:

* **Default** window, 5PM to 8AM local time Mon-Sunday 
* Weekday window, 10PM to 6AM local time Monday – Thursday: **Requires customer opt-in** 
* Weekend window, 10PM to 6AM local time Friday - Sunday: **Requires customer opt-in**  

Once the maintenance window selection is made, all planned maintenance updates will only occur during the window of your choice.   

> [!Note]
> In addition to planned maintenance updates, in rare circumstances unplanned maintenance events can cause unavailability. 

### Supported service level objectives

The SQL Maintenance Window feature is available on all Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance SLOs except for:
* Hyperscale 
* Legacy Gen4 vCore
* DTU S0 and S1 

### Cost

SQL Maintenance Window is free of charge to all customers with [subscription types](/support/legal/offer-details/) Pay-As-You-Go, Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), Microsoft Enterprise, or Microsoft Customer Agreement.

## Notifications

Maintenance Notifications can be configured to alert customers on upcoming planned maintenance events 24 hours in advance, at the time of maintenance, and when the maintenance window is complete. For more information, see [SQL Maintenance Window Notifications](advance-notifications.md).
