title: Maintenance window FAQ
summary: This article answers frequently asked questions about the maintenance window for [Azure SQL database](sql-database-paas-overview.md) and [SQL managed instance](../managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md).
sections:
  - name: General
    questions: 
      - question: What is the maintenance window feature?
        answer: |
         The maintenance window feature provides you with the ability to onboard a SQL DB resource to prescheduled time blocks outside of business hours. See [Maintenance window schedules](maintenance-window.md#gain-more-predictability-with-maintenance-window) for more information.

      - question: What is my default maintenance window if I do not choose any specific window? 
        answer: |
          The default window remains 5PM to 8AM local time, Monday - Sunday. 

      - question: Users work in a different time zone than the Azure data center. Which time zone is local?
        answer: |
          Local time is determined by the Azure region that hosts the resource. It is not determined by the time zone of the database or managed instance.

      - question: Can I choose a specific time/day for the maintenance window?
        answer: |
          No, you can choose between pre-scheduled weekday or weekend windows. The maintenance can happen any time or day within the window.  

      - question: What maintenance updates are typically performed during a maintenance window? 
        answer: |
          The maintenance window batches all hardware, operating system software and SQL engine updates into one update event to minimize impact to customers.

      - question: What can I expect during a maintenance event?
        answer: |
          During a maintenance update, databases are fully available and accessible but some of the maintenance updates require a failover as Azure takes SQL Databases offline for a short time to apply the maintenance updates (on average, eight seconds in duration). Planned maintenance updates occur once every 35 days on average, which means customer can expect approximately one planned maintenance event per month per Azure SQL Database and managed instance, and only during the maintenance window slots selected by the customer.

      - question: In which regions is choosing a maintenance window Available?
        answer: | 
          For a list of available regions, see [Maintenance window availability](maintenance-window.md#availability).
      
      - question: I don’t see my region in the available regions list, what can I do? 
        answer: |
          You can open a ticket to check if your region will be available soon. 
      
      - question: What is the pricing for maintenance window? 
        answer: |
          Choosing a maintenance window is free of charge to all customers with paid Azure subscription types, see [Maintenance window cost](maintenance-window.md#cost).
        
      - question: Would I receive a notification of the maintenance window?
        answer: |
          Customers can expect to receive notification 24 hours prior to the maintenance event, immediately before maintenance starts, and when the maintenance window is completed. The Resource health center can be checked for more information. Notification email alerts can also be configured.

      - question: Which service level objectives (SLOs) are supported for a configurable maintenance window? 
        answer: |
          Feature is available in most service tiers with some exceptions, see [maintenance window supported service level objectives](maintenance-window.md#supported-service-level-objectives).

      - question: If I have selected a maintenance window for a resource, and I downscale to a service tier where choosing a maintenance window is not supported, what happens to my database?
        answer: |
          In this case, the maintenance window would revert to the default option which is 5PM to 8AM local time.
      
      - question: Can I cancel or postpone a maintenance event using maintenance window?
        answer: |
          No. Cancelling or postponing an upcoming maintenance window within 24 hours is not supported. 

      - question: How long does it take to process a maintenance window schedule change?
        answer: |
          Changes made to the maintenance window schedule may take up to 24 hours to take effect.

      - question: What happens when a maintenance event fails?
        answer: |
          Although rare, failures or interruptions during a maintenance event can occur.  In the event of a failure, changes are rolled back and the maintenance will be rescheduled to another time.    

      - question: I would like to roll out the maintenance schedule updates to my non-production databases first to validate the changes before applied to production databases. Can maintenance windows be rolled out first in our test environment before production? 
        answer: |
          No, we currently do not support that option.  

      - question: How do I validate that my databases are set up for maintenance window?
        answer: |
          The managed database screen will show the current maintenance window schedule.

      - question: Can I configure a different maintenance window for each database in an elastic pool?
        answer: |
         If the database is part of an elastic pool, the maintenance window configuration of the elastic pool will be applied. Standalone databases can have their own maintenance window configuration.

      - question: What are supported options to configure a maintenance window for an existing Azure SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance?
        answer: |
          Azure Portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure API.
