# Maintenance window (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

The maintenance window feature allows for the configuration of predictable maintenance window schedules for [Azure SQL Database](sql-database-paas-overview.md) and [SQL managed instance](../managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md). 

For more information on maintenance events, see [Plan for Azure maintenance events in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance](planned-maintenance.md).

## Overview

Azure performs planned maintenance updates on Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance resources periodically that often include updates to underlying hardware, software including underlying operating system (OS), and the SQL engine. During a maintenance update, resources are fully available and accessible but some of the maintenance updates require a failover as Azure takes instances offline for a short time to apply the maintenance updates (eight seconds in duration on average).  Planned maintenance updates occur once every 35 days on average, which means customer can expect approximately one planned maintenance event per month per Azure SQL Database or SQL managed instance, and only during the maintenance window slots selected by the customer.   

The maintenance window is intended for business workloads that are sensitive to the potential connectivity interruptions that can result from planned maintenance events during the default window.  

The maintenance window can be configured using the Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, or Azure API. It can be configured on creation or for existing SQL databases and SQL managed instances.

### Gain more predictability with maintenance window

By default, all Azure SQL Databases and managed instance databases are updated only during 5PM to 8AM local times daily to avoid peak business hours interruptions. Local time is determined by the [Azure region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/) that hosts the resource. You can further adjust the maintenance updates to a time suitable to your database by choosing from two additional maintenance window slots:

* **Default** window, 5PM to 8AM local time Monday - Sunday 
* Weekday window, 10PM to 6AM local time Monday – Thursday: **Requires customer opt-in** 
* Weekend window, 10PM to 6AM local time Friday - Sunday: **Requires customer opt-in**  

Once the maintenance window selection is made, all planned maintenance updates will only occur during the window of your choice.   

> [!Note]
> In addition to planned maintenance updates, in rare circumstances unplanned maintenance events can cause unavailability. 

### Cost

Choosing a maintenance window is free of charge for the following subscription [offer types](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/): Pay-As-You-Go, Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), Microsoft Enterprise, or Microsoft Customer Agreement.

> [!Note]
> An Azure offer is the type of the Azure subscription you have. For example, a subscription with [pay-as-you-go rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/), [Azure in Open](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0111p/), and [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0063p/) are all Azure offers. Each offer or plan has different terms and benefits. Your offer or plan is shown on the subscription's Overview. For more information on switching your subscription to a different offer, see [Change your Azure subscription to a different offer](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/switch-azure-offer).

## Advance notifications

Maintenance notifications can be configured to alert customers on upcoming planned maintenance events 24 hours in advance, at the time of maintenance, and when the maintenance window is complete. For more information, see [Advance Notifications](advance-notifications.md).

## Availability

### Supported service level objectives

Choosing a maintenance window other than the default is available on all SLOs **except for**:

## Gateway maintenance 

To get the maximum benefit from maintenance windows, make sure your client applications are using the redirect connection policy. For more on client connection policy in Azure SQL Database see [Azure SQL Database Connection policy](../database/connectivity-architecture.md#connection-policy), and in Azure SQL managed instance see [Azure SQL Managed Instance connection types](../../azure-sql/managed-instance/connection-types-overview.md). 

Redirect is the recommended connection policy, where clients establish connections directly to the node hosting the database, leading to reduced latency and improved throughput.  

The maintenance window schedule for gateway nodes are not changed by the Azure SQL Database or managed instance maintenance window. The gateway nodes receive maintenance only during the default schedule, 5PM to 8AM local time Monday - Sunday. Therefore, any connections using the proxy connection policy could be affected by both the chosen maintenance window and the gateway node maintenance window. Clients using the proxy connection policy would be terminated and could immediately re-connect to a different gateway. However, client connections using the redirect connection policy would be unaffected by a gateway node maintenance failover.
