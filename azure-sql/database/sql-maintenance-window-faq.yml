      - question: What maintenance updates are typically performed during a SQL Maintenance window? 
        answer: |
          The SQL Maintenance Window can include updates to underlying hardware, software including underlying operating system (OS) and SQL engine.

      - question: What can I expect during a maintenance event?
        answer: |
          During a maintenance update, Azure SQL Database are fully available and accessible but some of the maintenance updates require a failover as Azure takes SQL Databases offline for a short time to apply the maintenance updates (on average, eight seconds in duration). Planned maintenance updates occur once every 35 days on average, which means customer can expect approximately one planned maintenance event per month per Azure SQL Database and Managed Instance, and only during the maintenance window slots selected by the customer.

      - question: What is the pricing for SQL Maintenance Window? 
        answer: |
          SQL Maintenance Window is free of charge to all customers with [subscription types](/support/legal/offer-details/) Pay-As-You-Go, Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), Microsoft Enterprise, or Microsoft Customer Agreement.
        
      - question: Would I receive a notification of the Maintenance Window?
        answer: |
          Customers can expect to receive notification 24 hours prior to the maintenance event, immediately before maintenance starts, and when the maintenance window is completed. The Resource health center can be checked for more information. Notification email alerts can also be configured, for more information see [SQL Maintenance Window Notifications walkthrough](TBD).

      - question: Which Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are not supported for selecting a SQL Maintenance Window? 
        answer: |
          Service tiers where SQL Maintenance Windows cannot be configured:
           - Hyperscale 
           - Legacy Gen4 vCore
           - DTU S0 and S1 

      - question: If I have selected a SQL Maintenance Window for a resource, and I downscale to a service tier where SQL Maintenance Windows is not supported, would the Maintenance Window revert to default?
        answer: |
          Yes.
      
      - question: Can I cancel or postpone a maintenance event? 
        answer: |
          No.

      - question: What happens if SQL maintenance fails?
        answer: |
          There is no change to the database. Changes will be rolled back and the maintenance will be rescheduled.  

      - question: Can the maintenance be rolled out first in our test environment before production? 
        answer: |
          No, we currently do not support that option.  

      - question: Can I see my databases are in each SQL Maintenance Window?
        answer: |
          Yes, on the managed database screen. TBD

      - question: Can I configure a different SQL Maintenance Window for each database in an elastic pool?
        answer: |
          No. If the database is part of an elastic pool, the maintenance configuration of the elastic pool will be applied. Standalone databases can have their own SQL Maintenance Window configuration.

      - question: What are supported options to configure a SQL Maintenance Window for an existing Azure SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance?
        answer: |
          Azure Portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure API.
