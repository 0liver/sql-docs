summary: This article answers frequently asked questions about SQL Maintenance Windows.
sections:
  - name: General
    questions: 
      - question: What is the SQL Maintenance Window feature?
        answer: |
         The SQL Maintenance Window (SMW) feature provides you with the ability to onboard a SQL DB resource to prescheduled time blocks outside of business hours. See [SQL Maintenance Window schedules](sql-maintenance-window.md#gain-more-predictability-with-sql-maintenance-windows) for more information.

      - question: What is my default SQL Maintenance Window if I do not choose any specific window? 
        answer: |
          The default window remains 5PM to 8AM local time, Monday - Sunday.

      - question: Can I choose a specific time/day in SQL Maintenance Windows?
        answer: |
          No, you can choose between pre-scheduled Weekday or Weekend windows. The maintenance can happen any time or day within the window.  

      - question: What maintenance updates are typically performed during a SQL Maintenance window? 
        answer: |
          The SQL Maintenance Window batches all HW, OS software and SQL engine updates into one update event to minimize impact to customers.

      - question: What can I expect during a maintenance event?
        answer: |
          During a maintenance update, Azure SQL Database are fully available and accessible but some of the maintenance updates require a failover as Azure takes SQL Databases offline for a short time to apply the maintenance updates (on average, eight seconds in duration). Planned maintenance updates occur once every 35 days on average, which means customer can expect approximately one planned maintenance event per month per Azure SQL Database and Managed Instance, and only during the maintenance window slots selected by the customer.

      - question: In which regions is SQL Maintenance Window Available?
        answer: | 
          Available in limited regions to start but more regions to be added in over coming months, see [SQL Maintenance Window](sql-maintenance-window.md#availability).
      
      - question: I don’t see my region in the available regions list, what can I do? 
        answer: |
          We are working on adding more regions, you can open a ticket to check if your Region will be available soon. 
      
      - question: What is the pricing for SQL Maintenance Window? 
        answer: |
          SQL Maintenance Window is free of charge to all customers with paid Azure subscription types, see [SQL Maintenance Window cost](sql-maintenance-window.md#cost).
        
      - question: Would I receive a notification of the Maintenance Window?
        answer: |
          Customers can expect to receive notification 24 hours prior to the maintenance event, immediately before maintenance starts, and when the maintenance window is completed. The Resource health center can be checked for more information. Notification email alerts can also be configured.

      - question: Which service level objectives (SLOs) are  supported for  SQL Maintenance Window? 
        answer: |
          Feature is available in all offer tiers except Gen4 vCore, Hyperscale and low end DTUs (Basic, S0, S1) SLOs, see [SQL maintenance window supported service level objectives](sql-maintenance-window.md#supported-service-level-objectives).

      - question: If I have selected a SQL Maintenance Window for a resource, and I downscale to a service tier where SQL Maintenance Windows is not supported, what happens to my database?
        answer: |
          In this case, SQL Maintenance Window would revert to the default option which is 5PM to 8AM local time.
      
      - question: Can I cancel or postpone a maintenance event using SQL Maintenace Window
        answer: |
          No.

      - question: What happens when a SQL maintenance event fails?
        answer: |
          Although rare, failures or interruptions during a SQL maintance event can occur.  In the event of a failure, changes are rolled back and the maintenance will be rescheduled to another time.    

      - question: I would like to roll out the SQL maintenance updates to my non prod databases first to validate the changes before applied to production databases, Can SQL maintenance be rolled out first in our test environment before production? 
        answer: |
          No, we currently do not support that option.  

      - question: How do I validate that my databases are set up for SQL Maintenance Window?
        answer: |
          Yes, on the managed database screen.

      - question: Can I configure a different SQL Maintenance Window for each database in an elastic pool?
        answer: |
         If the database is part of an elastic pool, the SQL maintenance window configuration of the elastic pool will be applied. Standalone databases can have their own SQL maintenance window configuration.

      - question: What are supported options to configure a SQL Maintenance Window for an existing Azure SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance?
        answer: |
          Azure Portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure API.
