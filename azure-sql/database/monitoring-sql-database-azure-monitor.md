# Monitoring Azure SQL Database with Azure Monitor

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. 

This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure SQL Database. Azure SQL Database uses [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview). If you are unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource).


## Monitoring overview page in Azure portal

View your Azure Monitor metrics for all connected resources by going to the Azure Monitor page directly in the Azure Portal. Or, on the **Overview** page of an Azure SQL DB, click on **Metrics** under the Monitoring heading to reach Azure Monitor.

## Azure SQL Insights

Some services in Azure have a special focused pre-built monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These special dashboards are called "insights". For more information, see the [SQL Insights (preview)](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/sql-insights-overview).

After creating a monitoring profile, you can configure your Azure Monitor SQL Insights for SQL-specific metrics for Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance.

## Monitoring data 

Azure SQL Database collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-Azure-resources). 

See [Monitoring Azure SQL Database with Azure Monitor reference](monitoring-sql-database-azure-monitor-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by Azure SQL Database.

## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations. Resource logs were previously referred to as diagnostic logs.

Diagnostic settings available include:

- **log**: SQLInsights, AutomaticTuning, QueryStoreRuntimeStatistics, QueryStoreWaitStatistics, Errors, DatabaseWaitStatistics, Timeouts, Blocks, Deadlocks    
- **metric**: Basic, InstanceAndAppAdvanced, WorkloadManagement
- **destination details**: Send to Log Analytics workspace, Archive to a storage account, Stream to an event hub, Send to partner solution
    - The Log Analytics solution is recommended. For more information on these options, see [Create diagnostic settings in Azure portal](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md&tabs=CMD#create-in-azure-portal).

For more information on the resource logs and diagnostics available, see [Diagnostic telemetry for export](metrics-diagnostic-telemetry-logging-streaming-export-configure?tabs=azure-portal#diagnostic-telemetry-for-export). 

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for Azure SQL Database are listed in [Azure SQL Database monitoring data reference](monitoring-sql-database-azure-monitor-reference.md#resource-logs).

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

## Analyzing metrics

You can analyze metrics for Azure SQL Database with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started) for details on using this tool. 

For a list of the platform metrics collected for Azure SQL Database, see [Monitoring Azure SQL Database data reference metrics](monitoring-sql-database-azure-monitor-reference.md#metrics)  

For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

<!--  Optional: Call out additional information to help your customers. For example, you can include additional information here about how to use metrics explorer specifically for your service. Remember that the UI is subject to change quite often so you will need to maintain these screenshots yourself if you add them in. -->

## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs-schema#top-level-resource-logs-schema) The schema for [service name] resource logs is found in the [Azure SQL Database Data Reference](monitoring-sql-database-azure-monitor-reference.md#schemas) 

The [Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log) is a type of platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for Azure SQL Database, see [Monitoring Azure SQL Database data reference](monitoring-sql-database-azure-monitor-reference.md#resource-logs)  

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring Azure SQL Database data reference](monitoring-sql-database-azure-monitor-reference.md##azure-monitor-logs-tables)  

### Sample Kusto queries

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the [service-name] menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current [Service resource]. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other [resource] or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/scope/) for details.

<!-- REQUIRED: Include queries that are helpful for figuring out the health and state of your service. Ideally, use some of these queries in the alerts section. It's possible that some of your queries may be in the Log Analytics UI (sample or example queries). Check if so.  -->

Following are queries that you can use to help you monitor your [Service] resource. 

**Log_write_percent** from the past hour

<!-- Put in a code section here. -->  
```Kusto
AzureMetrics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.SQL"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(60min)
| where MetricName in ('log_write_percent')
| parse _ResourceId with * "/microsoft.sql/servers/" Resource// subtract Resource name for _ResourceId
| summarize Log_Maximum_last60mins = max(Maximum), Log_Minimum_last60mins = min(Minimum), Log_Average_last60mins = avg(Average) by Resource, MetricName
```

## Alerts

<!-- SUGGESTED: Include useful alerts on metrics, logs, log conditions or activity log. Ask your PMs if you don't know. 
This information is the BIGGEST request we get in Azure Monitor so do not avoid it long term. People don't know what to monitor for best results. Be prescriptive  
-->

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-overview), [logs](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-unified-log), and the [activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log-alerts). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks

<!-- only include next line if applications run on your service and work with App Insights. --> If you are creating or running an application which run on <*service*> [Azure Monitor Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) may offer additional types of alerts.
<!-- end -->

The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for [service-name].

<!-- Fill in the table with metric and log alerts that would be valuable for your service. Change the format as necessary to make it more readable -->
| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| | | |
| | | |
