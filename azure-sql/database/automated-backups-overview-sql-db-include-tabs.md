## Backup integrity

On an ongoing basis, the Azure SQL engineering team automatically tests the restore of automated database backups. 

Upon point-in-time restore, databases also receive DBCC CHECKDB integrity checks.

Any issues found during the integrity check will result in an alert to the engineering team. For more information, see [Data Integrity in SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/data-integrity-in-azure-sql-database/).

All database backups are taken with the CHECKSUM option to provide additional backup integrity.

## Compliance

When you migrate your database from a DTU-based service tier to a vCore-based service tier, the PITR retention is preserved to ensure that your application's data recovery policy isn't compromised. If the default retention doesn't meet your compliance requirements, you can change the PITR retention period. For more information, see [Change the PITR backup retention period](#change-the-short-term-retention-policy).
